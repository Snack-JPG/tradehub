## 🎯 Recommended: Start Here

**LAUNCH PRICING**:
- **Setup**: £1,295 (instead of £1,495)
- **Monthly**: £69 (instead of £75)

**Positioning**:
"Launch special - first 10 clients only"

**Year 1 Total**: £2,123

### Why This Works:

1. **Psychology**: "Special price" creates urgency
2. **Fair Value**: Still 4x your original idea (£2,123 vs £660)
3. **Easy Yes**: Under psychological £1,500 barrier
4. **Profitable**: £1,295 for 8hrs work = £162/hr (good!)
5. **MRR**: £69/month per client is sustainable

### Client Math (Show Them This):

> "If you get just **2 extra jobs per month** from this website:
> - 2 jobs × £300 avg = £600/month revenue
> - Your cost: £69/month
> - **Your profit: £531/month** (771% ROI)
>
> The site pays for itself from job #1, and everything after is pure profit."

**This makes £69/month look like a steal!**

## 📊 Scenario Planning

### Scenario 1: Your Original Pricing
- **Price**: £300 + £30/month
- **Clients to hit £5k MRR**: 167 clients
- **Year 1 revenue** (10 clients): £6,600
- **Feasibility**: Possible but exhausting

### Scenario 2: Recommended Pricing
- **Price**: £1,295 + £69/month
- **Clients to hit £5k MRR**: 73 clients
- **Year 1 revenue** (10 clients): £21,230
- **Feasibility**: Very achievable

### Scenario 3: Premium Positioning
- **Price**: £2,500 + £150/month
- **Clients to hit £5k MRR**: 34 clients
- **Year 1 revenue** (10 clients): £43,000
- **Feasibility**: Harder conversions but worth it

**The difference**: 10 clients at your pricing = £6,600
**10 clients at recommended = £21,230**
**You're leaving £14,630 on the table!**

## 🧠 Psychology of Pricing

### Why Higher Prices Actually Help:

1. **Anchoring Effect**
   - Show three tiers
   - Middle tier sells best (looks like good value)
   - Expensive tier makes middle look reasonable

2. **Quality Signal**
   - £300 signals "cheap/amateur"
   - £1,500 signals "professional"
   - £3,000 signals "premium/expert"

3. **Client Quality**
   - Cheap attracts hagglers, late payers, churners
   - Mid-range attracts serious businesses
   - Premium attracts ideal clients who value expertise

4. **Confidence**
   - If you charge £300, client thinks: "What's wrong with it?"
   - If you charge £1,500, client thinks: "This must be good"
   - Price = Perceived value

## 💬 Handling Price Objections

### "That's too expensive"

**Response**:
> "I understand! Let me ask - how many jobs do you need per month to cover £69?
>
> If your average job is £300, you need less than 1 extra job every 4 months to break even. And most clients see 5-10 extra enquiries per month.
>
> Plus, the setup fee (£1,295) is one-time. After that, it's just £69/month for a 24/7 salesperson bringing you leads."

### "My mate can do it for £200"

**Response**:
> "That's great! The question is - will it actually bring you customers?
>
> This isn't just a website, it's a lead generation system:
> - Optimized for Google searches
> - Mobile-first (70% of searches)
> - Your Checkatrade reviews featured
> - Click-to-call buttons everywhere
> - Already configured to rank for 'electrician Halesowen'
>
> A £200 site that looks nice but doesn't bring customers is expensive. A £1,295 site that brings you 5-10 jobs per month is cheap."

### "I'll just use Wix"

**Response**:
> "You absolutely can! Here's what you'll need to figure out:
> - Design (20+ hours)
> - Copywriting (your services, reviews, etc.)
> - SEO setup (schema markup, meta tags, sitemap)
> - Mobile optimization
> - Google Business integration
> - Ongoing updates
>
> If your time is worth less than £60/hour, Wix makes sense.
>
> But if your time is worth £100-200/hour (as an electrician), paying me £1,295 to do 20 hours of work is a bargain. You save 20 hours to do £2,000-4,000 worth of actual electrical work."

### "Can you do it cheaper?"

**Response**:
> "I want to work with you, so let me ask - what's your budget?
>
> [They say £500]
>
> I can do a simpler version for £750 one-time, no monthly fee:
> - Basic site (5 pages instead of full)
> - No ongoing support
> - You handle hosting yourself
>
> But the full package at £1,295 + £69/month includes everything and ongoing support. Most clients prefer that because they don't want to think about it."
