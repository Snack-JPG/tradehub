## 📧 Cold Outreach Email Templates

### Template 1: "Your Site is Ready"

```
Subject: Website Ready for MJB Electrical Services

Hi there,

I noticed MJB Electrical has an incredible Checkatrade rating (9.93/10!) but I couldn't find a website when I searched.

I built you one anyway: [Preview Link]
Password: demo2026

It's completely done and ready to go live. No strings attached - just wanted to show what's possible.

If you like it, I can hand it over for £XXX one-time + £XX/month hosting.
If not, no worries!

Best,
[Your Name]
TradeHub
```

**Why This Works**:
- Shows initiative (built it already)
- No-pressure approach
- Easy to say yes (it's done)
- Low risk (see before buying)

### Template 2: "Missing Calls?"

```
Subject: Are you losing calls to competitors with websites?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: When someone searches "electrician Halesowen" on Google, do they find you?

Your Checkatrade rating is better than most (9.93/10), but without a website, you might be losing 5-10 calls per week to competitors who show up on Google.

I created a demo site showing what you could rank for:
[Preview Link]

Would 10 extra enquiries per month be worth £100/month to you?

[Your Name]
TradeHub - Helping Local Tradespeople Get Found Online
```

**Why This Works**:
- Pain point focused (losing business)
- Quantifies value (10 calls/month)
- Simple math (ROI is clear)
- Positions you as helper, not seller

### Template 3: "TradeHub Partnership"

```
Subject: TradeHub Partnership Opportunity

Hi [Name],

I run TradeHub, a directory for local tradespeople in the West Midlands.

I'm offering 10 electricians in your area:
✅ Professional website (like this: [Preview])
✅ Featured TradeHub listing
✅ Google Business Profile setup
✅ SEO for local searches

Package: £1,500 setup + £100/month (or £1,000/year)

Interested? I have 3 spots left this month.

[Your Name]
TradeHub
```

**Why This Works**:
- Positions you as platform, not freelancer
- Bundle creates value
- Scarcity (3 spots left)
- Professional package pricing

[Your Name]
```

## 🔗 TradeHub Backlink Optimization

### When Client Signs:

**1. Remove noindex**:
```typescript
// In app/layout.tsx, change to:
robots: {
  index: true,
  follow: true,
}
```

**2. Update TradeHub URL**:
Create `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TRADEHUB_URL=https://tradehub.com/electricians/mjb-electrical-services-halesowen
```

**3. Optimize Anchor Text**:
Instead of generic "TradeHub Listing", use:
- "Find us on TradeHub - Local Electrician Directory"
- "Listed on TradeHub West Midlands"
- "Verified TradeHub Professional"

**4. Add TradeHub Badge/Widget**:
Create a "Verified on TradeHub" badge image
Link it to their listing
Increases click-through and link juice

### TradeHub Landing Pages:

Create specific landing pages for each trade/location:
- `/electricians/west-midlands`
- `/plumbers/birmingham`
- `/builders/halesowen`

Each client site links to their specific page, creating relevance.

### Link Quality Factors:

**High-Quality Backlinks** (What You're Creating):
✅ Relevant sites (electrician → directory)
✅ Local sites (West Midlands businesses)
✅ Contextual links (in footer, not spammy)
✅ Natural anchor text (varied, not keyword-stuffed)
✅ Do-follow links (pass SEO juice)

**Low-Quality** (Avoid):
❌ Link farms
❌ Paid directories
❌ Spam comments
❌ Unrelated sites

Your strategy = High quality, sustainable.
