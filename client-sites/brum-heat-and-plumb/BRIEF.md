## Reviews

### Jayne Orton — ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Needed an emergency plumber over the weekend for a problem toilet. Rang loads but Chris was the only one who answered the phone. He came out on a Sunday exactly when he said even ringing half an hour before he got to me to let me know he was on his way. Sorted the problem promptly and efficiently"

### Random Brummy — ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Chris was a life saver. My boiler totally packed up and I had water leaking. Called this bloke and he not only came straight away but he sorted it all out quickly and for a great price. Friendly, knowledgeable and knew exactly what he was doing. Highly recommended 👌"

## Tone
Reliable, responsive, and reassuring. Chris is clearly the go-to emergency plumber who actually answers his phone and shows up when others don't. The site should feel trustworthy and emergency-focused — when someone's boiler breaks down on a Sunday morning or they have a burst pipe at midnight, they need to feel confident calling Brum Heat and Plumb. Personal, not corporate — just dependable Chris who gets the job done.

## Design Direction
- **Emergency-focused:** Boiler breakdown = urgent, stressful situation
- **Trust signals:** 5★ rating, Chris's name, personal service, Gas Safe cert
- **Weekend availability:** "Chris answered on Sunday" = key differentiator
- **Speed emphasis:** "Came straight away", "fast response"
- **Professional competence:** Gas Safe qualified, problem solver
- **Color palette:**
  - Deep blue/navy (trust, water, professional)
  - Warm orange/red (heating, urgency, emergency)
  - Clean white (cleanliness, modern)
  - Accent yellow (gas, warning, attention)
- **Imagery concepts:** Warmth restored, water controlled, reliable heating, emergency response

## Pricing Strategy
£300 setup + £30/month (or £200 + £10/month depending on complexity)
*Note: This is cold outreach - Chris hasn't requested this yet*

## Competitive Advantage
- **25 reviews with 5.0 rating** — strong social proof for smaller business
- **Personal service** — Chris himself answers and does the work
- **Weekend emergency service** — key differentiator ("only one who answered")
- **Fast response** — "came straight away" = competitive edge
