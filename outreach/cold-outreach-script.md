## 📞 Cold Call Script

### Opening (10 seconds — don't waffle)

> "Hi, is that [Name]? My name's Austin, I'm from TradeHub. We're building a directory of trusted tradespeople across the West Midlands — and you came up with some absolutely cracking reviews in our research."

**Pause.** Let them react. They'll probably say "oh right" or "cheers."

### The Gift (20 seconds)

> "So I had a look and noticed you don't have a website at the moment — so I went ahead and built you one. Completely free. It's already live, I can send you the link right now if you want to have a look?"

**Send the link immediately.** Let them look at it while you talk.

### While They're Looking

> "It's got your services, your area, some of your best reviews pulled through — basically everything someone needs to see before they pick up the phone. And it's all yours, no catch."

### If They Ask "Why Free?" (The Objection Handler)

> "Honestly? The only thing on there is a small link back to TradeHub at the bottom. We're building something that's going to shake up the trusted trader space — none of that paying-for-reviews rubbish — and we want the best people on there from day one. Your reviews speak for themselves, so it was a no-brainer."

### Close

> "All I need from you is a quick yes that you're happy with it, and if there's anything you want changed — different photos, updated services, whatever — just let me know and I'll sort it. Sound good?"

## 💬 WhatsApp / Text Message (Cold)

### Message 1 — The Hook

> Hi [Name] 👋 My name's Austin from TradeHub. We're building a directory of the most trusted tradespeople in the West Midlands and your reviews are some of the best we've come across — seriously impressive.

### Message 2 — The Gift (send 30 seconds later)

> I noticed you don't have a website so I went ahead and made you one — completely free because honestly your work speaks for itself. Here it is: [LINK]

### Message 3 — The Soft Close (send 1 min later)

> It's got your services, areas you cover, and your best reviews all in one place. If you want anything changed just let me know. The only thing on there is a small link back to our directory — we're trying to change how people find trusted traders 💪

---

## 💬 WhatsApp / Text (If They Already Have a Website)

> Hi [Name] 👋 Austin from TradeHub here. We're putting together a directory of the best tradespeople across the West Midlands and your name kept coming up — your reviews are quality. Would you be up for being listed? It's completely free, we're just launching and want the best people on there first. Here's what your listing would look like: [LINK]

## 🔑 Key Principles

### DO:
- **Build the site before you reach out.** The link is the closer.
- **Lead with their reviews.** Everyone loves hearing they're good at their job.
- **Be casual and fast.** This isn't a boardroom pitch, it's a chat.
- **Send the link within 30 seconds.** Don't describe it, show it.
- **Sound like you're doing them a favour** (because you are).

### DON'T:
- Don't say "would you be interested in..." — you already built it, it's done.
- Don't oversell TradeHub. Keep focus on THEM.
- Don't apologise for calling. You're bringing good news.
- Don't mention competitors (Checkatrade, MyBuilder etc) unless they do.
- Don't ask permission to send the link. Just send it.

## Handling Objections

**"What's the catch?"**
> "No catch at all. There's a small TradeHub link in the footer — that's it. We're launching a new kind of trades directory and we want the best people on there. Your reviews made that decision easy."

**"I'm not interested"**
> "No worries at all. The website's there if you change your mind — it's not going anywhere. Have a good one."
(Don't push. Some will come back later when they Google themselves and see it.)

**"I already get enough work"**
> "That's great to hear — honestly that tracks with your reviews. The website's there anyway if you ever want to point people somewhere. No pressure at all."

**"How do you make money then?"**
> "Long term we'll have premium features — priority placement, lead gen, that kind of thing. But the listing and website are free, always will be. We need great tradespeople on the platform first."

**"Can I think about it?"**
> "Course you can. The site's live already so have a play with it, show the missus, whatever. Just drop me a message if you want anything changed."

## After They Say Yes

1. Confirm their details are correct (phone, services, areas)
2. Ask if they have any photos of their work they'd like on there
3. Tell them you'll check in in a week to see how it's going
4. Add them to the CRM / tracking sheet

---

## Volume Target

Aim for **5 outreach messages per session.** Even a 30% conversion rate = ~15 listings from 50 attempts. Most will say yes because there's literally no downside for them.
