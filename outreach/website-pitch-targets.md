# TradeHub — Website Offer Outreach List

These 6 tradespeople have good reputations but no web presence beyond a Google Maps pin. They're getting work through word of mouth and the occasional Maps lookup — but the way people find tradespeople is changing fast, and they're not where customers are looking.

## The Core Angle: How People Find Tradespeople Now

**The old way:** Ask a mate, or scroll Google Maps.
**What's actually happening now:**

1. **Google search bar** — "emergency plumber Redditch" → results page is dominated by businesses with websites. No website = you don't appear.
2. **AI search (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot)** — more and more people ask AI "recommend a good plumber in Redditch." AI pulls answers from websites and structured content. No website = you literally don't exist to AI.
3. **Google Maps** — still works, but it's becoming the backup, not the first step.

This isn't a scare tactic — it's just true. And it's only going one direction. The tradespeople who have even a basic website now will be the ones AI recommends for years to come.

## The Pitch Framework

**Opening (personalised per trade):**
> Hi [Name], I found you through your Google reviews — [specific compliment]. I run TradeHub, a local trades directory for the Birmingham, Solihull and Redditch area.

**The shift:**
> I wanted to reach out because the way people find tradespeople is changing. It used to be word of mouth or scrolling Google Maps — now most people type into the Google search bar or even ask ChatGPT "who's a good [trade] near me?" And those results only pull from businesses that have a website. Your Google reviews are great, but without a website behind them, you're only showing up in one place when you could be showing up in three.

**The offer:**
> We've already listed you on our directory for free. But we're also helping a small number of local tradespeople get a proper website set up — nothing fancy, just clean and professional. Shows your services, your areas, your reviews, and a click-to-call button. Works on mobile. No upfront cost, just a small monthly fee that's less than what you'd earn from one extra job.

**The close:**
> Would it be worth a quick 5-minute chat? No pressure — I just think you're doing great work and more people should be able to find you.

## 1. Mayfield Heating and Plumbing ⭐ TOP PRIORITY

| | |
|---|---|
| **Contact** | Ali & Naz |
| **Phone** | 07730 052127 |
| **Trade** | Gas engineer / plumber |
| **Area** | Redditch, Bromsgrove, Studley, Alcester |
| **Rating** | ⭐ 5.0 (29 reviews) |
| **Gas Safe** | ✅ Yes |
| **Emergency work** | ✅ Yes |

**Why they're perfect:** Perfect 5-star rating, 29 reviews, Gas Safe registered, do emergency call-outs. High-intent searches like "emergency boiler repair Redditch" go straight to Google — and they're not in those results.

**Personalised hook:**
> "Ali, I came across your reviews and the one about you and Naz coming out on New Year's Day really stood out — that's the kind of service that sells itself. The thing is, when someone's boiler breaks at 10pm and they Google 'emergency boiler repair Redditch', they're not opening Google Maps — they're clicking the first result. Right now that's not you, but it easily could be."

## 2. Solihull Handyman (Dean) ⭐ TOP PRIORITY

| | |
|---|---|
| **Contact** | Dean |
| **Phone** | 07565 562834 |
| **Trade** | Handyman |
| **Area** | Solihull, Shirley, Knowle, Dorridge |
| **Rating** | ⭐ 4.6 (52 reviews) |

**Why they're perfect:** 52 reviews is huge for a sole trader — clearly run off his feet through word of mouth. Solihull is an affluent area where people Google before they call. A website turns his reputation into a 24/7 lead machine.

**Personalised hook:**
> "Dean, 52 reviews as a one-man operation is seriously impressive — you're clearly doing something right. But here's the thing: I asked ChatGPT 'who's a good handyman in Solihull' and you didn't come up. That's because AI only pulls from websites. More and more people are searching that way now, and a simple site would put you in front of all of them."

## 3. Angel Plastering Services

| | |
|---|---|
| **Contact** | Dave & Gareth Hall (father & son) |
| **Phone** | 07507 145205 |
| **Trade** | Plasterer |
| **Area** | Birmingham, Shirley, Solihull, Hall Green |
| **Rating** | ⭐ 4.9 (22 reviews) |

**Why they're perfect:** Father-son team with a near-perfect rating. Family business story resonates with customers — a website that tells that story converts browsers into callers.

**Personalised hook:**
> "Dave, I love that you and Gareth run this as a father-and-son team — that's the kind of thing people want to know before they pick up the phone. Right now your only online presence is a Google Maps pin. A website that tells your story and shows your 4.9-star reviews would make you the obvious choice when someone searches 'plasterer Solihull'."

## 4. Redditch Roofing Ltd

| | |
|---|---|
| **Contact** | Unknown (Ltd company) |
| **Phone** | 07925 218139 |
| **Trade** | Roofer |
| **Area** | Redditch, Bromsgrove, Studley, Alcester |
| **Rating** | ⭐ 4.7 (10 reviews) |

**Why they're perfect:** Registered Ltd company doing high-ticket roofing work but no website. A single roofing job is £500-5,000+ — one extra enquiry from a website pays for the entire year.

**Personalised hook:**
> "I noticed you're a registered limited company doing quality roofing in Redditch — but when I Google 'roofer Redditch', the results are all businesses with websites. For the kind of work you do, even one extra enquiry every few months would more than cover the cost of a basic site."

---

## 5. Topview1 Roofing

| | |
|---|---|
| **Contact** | Unknown |
| **Phone** | 01527 337098 (landline) |
| **Trade** | Roofer |
| **Area** | Redditch, Bromsgrove, Studley, Astwood Bank |
| **Rating** | ⭐ 4.5 (6 reviews) |

**Why they're perfect:** Landline number + business centre address = established old-school operation that hasn't gone digital. These are the hardest to convert but the most loyal once they're on board.

**Personalised hook:**
> "I can see you're an established business in Redditch — but the way people search for roofers has changed. Most people now type into Google or ask AI rather than scrolling through Maps. A simple website would make sure you show up in all those places, not just one."

## 6. R W B Plumbing

| | |
|---|---|
| **Contact** | Unknown |
| **Phone** | 07947 346245 |
| **Trade** | Plumber |
| **Area** | Birmingham, Kings Heath, Moseley, Hall Green |
| **Rating** | No Google reviews yet |

**Why they're perfect:** Completely off the radar — no reviews, no website, nothing. Longest sell but the most to gain. Emergency plumbing is pure high-intent search.

**Personalised hook:**
> "I'm putting together a local trades directory for Birmingham and I'm looking for reliable plumbers to feature. I noticed you don't have a website or online reviews yet — that's actually a great starting point because we can help you build both from scratch. Right now if someone in Kings Heath Googles 'plumber near me', there's no way to find you. We can fix that."

## The AI Search Angle (use in every pitch)

This is the differentiator that no other web agency is talking about yet:

> "You know how people are starting to use ChatGPT and AI to find things? When someone asks 'who's a good [trade] in [area]', the AI only recommends businesses it can find information about online — which means businesses with websites. Right now it can't recommend you because there's nothing for it to read. That's only going to matter more over the next few years, and the businesses that get set up now will be the ones AI keeps recommending."

This is honest, forward-looking, and creates urgency without being pushy.
