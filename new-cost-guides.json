        "question": "How much does it cost to tile a bathroom in the UK?",
        "answer": "Bathroom tiling costs £800-4,000+ depending on size and tile choice. A standard bathroom costs £1,200-2,500 including walls and floor. This includes waterproofing, labor, adhesive, and grout. Luxury tiles or complex designs cost significantly more. Always get itemized quotes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between wall and floor tiling costs?",
        "answer": "Floor tiling typically costs £25-50 per square metre while wall tiling costs £20-40 per square metre. Floors require more preparation, leveling, and often use larger, more expensive tiles. Bathroom floors need waterproofing which adds to costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does tiling take?",
        "answer": "A standard bathroom takes 3-5 days including preparation and grouting. Kitchen splashbacks take 1-2 days. Large floor areas take 1-2 days per room plus drying time. Complex patterns or extensive preparation can double these times. Always allow for adhesive curing before use."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I remove old tiles myself?",
        "answer": "You can remove old tiles yourself to save £8-20 per square metre, but it's dusty, hard work. Leave wall preparation and waterproofing to professionals. In bathrooms, improper removal can damage waterproofing, leading to expensive repairs later. Consider the time and effort involved."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need waterproofing for bathroom tiling?",
        "answer": "Yes, waterproofing is essential in wet areas like showers and around baths. It costs £200-800 extra but prevents water damage, mold, and structural problems. All reputable tilers include waterproofing in bathroom quotes. Skipping this step voids warranties and causes expensive problems."
      },
      {
        "question": "What tiles are best for bathrooms?",
        "answer": "Porcelain tiles are ideal for bathrooms - they're water-resistant, durable, and available in many styles. Ceramic tiles are cheaper but more porous. Natural stone needs sealing and more maintenance. Choose tiles with low water absorption rates for wet areas."
