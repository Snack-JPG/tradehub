        {
          "question": "Should I pay a plumber upfront?",
          "answer": "Never pay 100% upfront. A deposit of 10-25% for materials on large jobs is normal. For small jobs under £200, payment on completion is standard. Be very cautious of tradespeople demanding 50%+ upfront — this is a common scam tactic."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to provide materials or does the plumber?",
          "answer": "Most plumbers will source and supply materials, adding their markup (typically 15-30%). You can save money by buying parts yourself, but ensure they're the right specification. For specialist items like boilers or bathroom suites, plumbers often get trade discounts that offset their markup."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does a plumber charge for a quote?",
          "answer": "Most plumbers offer free quotes for standard jobs. For complex work requiring surveys (e.g., underfloor heating), they may charge £50-£150 which is often deducted if you proceed. Emergency call-outs typically include the quote in the call-out fee."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it cheaper to hire a plumber directly or through a platform?",
          "answer": "Hiring directly is usually cheaper as platforms often charge plumbers 10-20% commission, which gets passed to you. However, platforms like TradeHub that simply list verified tradespeople (rather than taking commission per job) let you contact plumbers directly at their standard rates."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference in cost between combi, system, and regular boilers?",
          "answer": "Combi boilers (most popular) cost £1,800-£3,000 installed. System boilers cost £2,000-£3,500 installed. Regular boilers cost £2,200-£4,000 installed (need separate hot water cylinder and cold water tank). Installation complexity also affects price — combis are usually quickest to install."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do plumbers charge more in winter?",
          "answer": "Yes, indirectly. Demand spikes in winter (frozen pipes, boiler breakdowns) so plumbers are busier and may charge premium rates for urgent work. Book non-urgent work in summer/autumn for better availability and potentially better rates."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I do if a plumber's quote seems too low?",
          "answer": "Be cautious. Very low quotes might mean: using cheap/counterfeit parts, not including VAT, planning to add extras once started, or the plumber is uninsured/unqualified. Always verify their credentials and get a detailed breakdown. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is."
