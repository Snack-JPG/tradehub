          "question": "Can I negotiate emergency electrician rates?",
          "answer": "Limited room for negotiation on emergency rates — they're already set at a premium. However, you can ask: (1) Is the call-out fee fixed or negotiable? (2) Do they offer discounts for pensioners/NHS/military? (3) Can you wait until morning for standard rates? Some electricians reduce call-out fees for repeat customers or if the job ends up being larger than expected."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do emergency electricians charge VAT?",
          "answer": "Yes, unless they're below the VAT threshold (turnover under £90,000/year). Always ask if VAT is included in the quoted price. VAT adds 20% to the total. Example: £200 + VAT = £240. Cash-only electricians who don't charge VAT are often evading tax — risky to use."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I get multiple quotes for emergency work?",
          "answer": "For true emergencies (fire risk, exposed wires, total power loss), no — call the first available registered electrician. For less urgent 'emergencies' (one circuit out, can wait a few hours), yes — call 2-3 electricians for quotes. Prices can vary by 30-50%."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if the emergency electrician can't fix it on the spot?",
          "answer": "You still pay the call-out fee and hourly rate for diagnosis. If parts are needed or the job is too complex, they should: (1) Make it safe (isolate faulty circuit), (2) Provide a written quote for the full repair, (3) Schedule a return visit. Some electricians waive the call-out fee if you book them for the full repair."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is home emergency cover worth it for electricians?",
          "answer": "Maybe. Home emergency insurance costs £40-£150/year and covers emergency electrical, plumbing, and heating. Pros: No emergency call-out fees, 24/7 availability. Cons: Often uses approved contractors only (not your choice), excess fees (£50-£100), may not cover all work. Worth it if you're in an older property or hate dealing with emergencies."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I do temporary fixes myself to avoid emergency costs?",
          "answer": "Limited safe DIY options. You CAN: reset tripped circuit breakers, unplug faulty appliances, turn off affected circuits at the consumer unit. You CANNOT safely: repair damaged wiring, replace consumer units, work inside sockets/switches while powered. Touching live electrics can kill you. When in doubt, call a professional."
        },
        {
          "question": "How quickly will an emergency electrician arrive?",
          "answer": "Depends on demand and your location. Typical response times in 2026: Urban areas (Birmingham, Solihull): 45 mins-2 hours. Rural areas: 1-3 hours. Christmas/New Year: 2-6 hours (high demand). Some advertise '30-minute response' but this often means 'on the road within 30 mins' not 'arrived at your door'."
