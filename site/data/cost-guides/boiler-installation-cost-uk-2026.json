        {
          "question": "Can I install a boiler myself to save money?",
          "answer": "No. Installing or working on a gas boiler without being Gas Safe registered is illegal and extremely dangerous. You risk carbon monoxide poisoning, gas leaks, explosions, and invalidating your home insurance. Only Gas Safe registered engineers can legally install boilers. DIY installation can also void the manufacturer warranty."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I buy a boiler online and pay an engineer just for installation?",
          "answer": "Generally not recommended. Most installers won't fit boilers they didn't supply because: (1) they can't guarantee parts are genuine, (2) no installer warranty if it's faulty, (3) removes their profit margin so they charge more for labour. You also lose the installer's trade discount. Savings are usually minimal and risk is higher."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need a power flush when installing a new boiler?",
          "answer": "Highly recommended if your existing system is 10+ years old. Sludge and debris in old radiators can damage a new boiler, voiding the warranty. Power flush costs £300-£600 but extends new boiler life by years. Many manufacturers require it for warranty validation. Budget boilers (under £800) often don't require it, but premium boilers (Worcester Bosch, Vaillant) do."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long should a boiler last?",
          "answer": "15-25 years depending on brand and maintenance. Budget boilers (Ideal, Baxi): 12-15 years. Mid-range (Worcester Bosch, Vaillant): 15-20 years. Premium boilers with annual servicing can last 20-25 years. Lack of servicing shortens lifespan significantly — expect 10-12 years without maintenance."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is a combi boiler cheaper to run than a system boiler?",
          "answer": "Usually yes, by 10-15%. Combis only heat water when you turn the tap on (no storage heat loss). System boilers keep a cylinder of water hot 24/7 (some heat loss). However, system boilers are better for large families with high demand — running multiple showers simultaneously. Your usage pattern matters more than boiler type."
        },
        {
          "question": "What size boiler do I need?",
          "answer": "Depends on home size and hot water demand. Rough guide: 1-2 bed flat (24-28kW combi), 3-bed house (28-35kW combi), 4-bed house (35-42kW combi or system boiler). Don't oversize — inefficient and wastes money. A Gas Safe engineer should calculate heat loss to size correctly."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I move my boiler to the loft or garage?",
          "answer": "Yes, but it adds £800-£1,500 to installation cost (new pipework, extended flue, possibly new gas pipe). Loft installations need boarding and access. Garage installs risk freezing in winter unless insulated. Most engineers advise keeping boilers in kitchens/utility rooms for easy servicing access."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need Building Regulations approval for a new boiler?",
          "answer": "Yes, but your Gas Safe engineer handles this. All boiler installations must comply with Building Regulations Part L (conservation of fuel and power). The engineer issues a Building Regulations Compliance Certificate after installation. You don't need to apply separately — it's included in their work."
