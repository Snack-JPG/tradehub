This includes the boiler, labor, and any required upgrades to pipes or controls."

      {
        "question": "What boiler type is best for my home?",
        "answer": "Combi boilers suit flats and small homes (instant hot water, no tank needed). System boilers work for larger homes with multiple bathrooms (need a cylinder but no loft tank). Regular boilers suit period properties with existing tanks. Consult a Gas Safe engineer for personalized advice based on your home's size and hot water demand."

        "answer": "Local recovery within 10 miles typically costs \u00a360-\u00a3100. Medium distances (10-30 miles) cost \u00a3100-\u00a3150. Long-distance recovery is usually \u00a32-\u00a33 per mile. Evening, weekend, and motorway recovery cost more due to additional requirements. Always get a quote before the recovery begins."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between breakdown cover and a recovery driver?",
        "answer": "Breakdown cover (like AA or RAC) is insurance that you pay annually. A recovery driver is the actual person who comes to tow your vehicle. You can either call your breakdown provider (who then sends a recovery driver) or contact a recovery driver directly if you don't have cover."
      },

        "question": "Can a recovery driver fix my car at the roadside?",
        "answer": "Some recovery drivers offer basic roadside assistance like jump-starts, tire changes, or fuel delivery. However, most focus on transportation rather than repairs. If you need mechanical fixes, they'll usually tow you to a garage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my vehicle insured while being recovered?",
        "answer": "A legitimate recovery driver will have goods in transit insurance covering your vehicle while in their care. Always confirm this before allowing them to recover your car. Your own insurance doesn't typically cover damage during recovery."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can a recovery driver reach me in Birmingham?",
        "answer": "Most reputable local recovery drivers aim for 30-60 minute response times for emergency callouts in Birmingham. Response times may be longer during peak hours, bad weather, or if you're in a remote area. Always ask for an ETA when you call."

        "answer": "A standard bedroom costs \u00a3250-500 to paint including walls, ceiling, and basic woodwork. Larger rooms cost \u00a3400-700. The price depends on room size, preparation required, paint quality, and number of coats. Always get itemized quotes to understand what's included."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I supply the paint or let the decorator buy it?",
        "answer": "Most decorators prefer to supply materials as they get trade discounts and know which products work best. However, you can supply your own paint if you want specific brands or colors. Discuss this upfront - some decorators may not warranty work done with customer-supplied materials."

      {
        "question": "How long does it take to paint a house?",
        "answer": "A 3-bedroom house interior typically takes 5-10 days depending on preparation required. Single rooms take 1-2 days including drying time between coats. Exterior painting takes 3-7 days depending on size and weather conditions. Always factor in drying time between coats."

        "question": "What's the difference between trade and retail paint prices?",
        "answer": "Trade paint typically costs 20-30% less than retail prices but is only available to registered decorators. However, trade paint is often higher quality and covers better than budget retail options. Professional decorators' material costs are usually competitive with DIY retail prices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to prime walls before painting?",
        "answer": "Primer is essential when changing colors dramatically (light to dark or vice versa), painting over stains, or painting new plaster. Most modern paints have good coverage, but primer ensures even color and better adhesion. Your decorator will advise based on your specific situation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I redecorate my home?",
        "answer": "Interior walls typically need repainting every 5-7 years in living areas, longer in bedrooms. Woodwork needs attention every 3-5 years. Exterior painting lasts 7-10 years with quality paint systems. High-traffic areas like hallways may need more frequent touch-ups."

Building regulations may apply to retaining walls over 1.2m high. Always check with your local authority if unsure."

        "question": "When is the best time to do landscaping work?",
        "answer": "Spring (March-May) and early autumn (September-October) are ideal for planting. Hard landscaping can be done year-round except in extreme weather. Winter work may be cheaper as landscapers are less busy, but weather can cause delays. Plan major projects to avoid peak wedding/barbecue season."

        "question": "How long does landscaping work take?",
        "answer": "Simple projects (lawn installation, basic patio) take 3-7 days. Complete garden makeovers take 2-8 weeks depending on complexity. Weather delays are common, especially for ground work. Phased projects spread over seasons allow plants to establish and spread costs."

        "question": "How much does fencing cost per metre in the UK?",
        "answer": "Fencing costs \u00a330-80 per metre installed depending on type and height. Panel fencing costs \u00a330-50 per metre, while closeboard fencing costs \u00a340-65 per metre. Premium materials and complex sites cost more. Always get quotes including posts, gravel boards, and installation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between panel and closeboard fencing costs?",
        "answer": "Panel fencing costs \u00a330-50 per metre and uses pre-made panels for quick installation. Closeboard fencing costs \u00a340-65 per metre but offers better durability and wind resistance. Closeboard takes longer to install but provides a premium finish and can be fully customized."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need planning permission for garden fencing?",
        "answer": "Most domestic fencing under 2 metres doesn't need planning permission. However, check for restrictions near highways (1m limit), in conservation areas, or for listed buildings. Always verify with your local planning authority and discuss boundary fencing with neighbors first."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does fence installation take?",
        "answer": "A typical garden fence (30-50 metres) takes 2-4 days depending on type and ground conditions. Panel fencing installs faster than closeboard. Hard ground, slopes, or access issues can extend timelines. Weather delays are common in winter months."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use wooden or concrete fence posts?",
        "answer": "Concrete posts cost \u00a35-10 more per metre but last 25-40 years versus 10-15 for wooden posts. They're worth the extra cost in wet or clay soils. Wooden posts are fine in well-drained soil and are easier to replace. Consider your soil conditions and budget."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I install fencing myself?",
        "answer": "DIY fencing can save 50-60% on labor costs but requires proper tools, time, and skill. You need post hole diggers, spirit level, and concrete mixing. Mistakes can be expensive to fix and may affect boundary relationships. Consider the time investment and physical effort required."
