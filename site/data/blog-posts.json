This includes the boiler, labor, and any required upgrades to pipes or controls."

      {
        "question": "What boiler type is best for my home?",
        "answer": "Combi boilers suit flats and small homes (instant hot water, no tank needed). System boilers work for larger homes with multiple bathrooms (need a cylinder but no loft tank). Regular boilers suit period properties with existing tanks. Consult a Gas Safe engineer for personalized advice based on your home's size and hot water demand."

        "answer": "Local recovery within 10 miles typically costs \u00a360-\u00a3100. Medium distances (10-30 miles) cost \u00a3100-\u00a3150. Long-distance recovery is usually \u00a32-\u00a33 per mile. Evening, weekend, and motorway recovery cost more due to additional requirements. Always get a quote before the recovery begins."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between breakdown cover and a recovery driver?",
        "answer": "Breakdown cover (like AA or RAC) is insurance that you pay annually. A recovery driver is the actual person who comes to tow your vehicle. You can either call your breakdown provider (who then sends a recovery driver) or contact a recovery driver directly if you don't have cover."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can a recovery driver fix my car at the roadside?",
        "answer": "Some recovery drivers offer basic roadside assistance like jump-starts, tire changes, or fuel delivery. However, most focus on transportation rather than repairs. If you need mechanical fixes, they'll usually tow you to a garage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my vehicle insured while being recovered?",
        "answer": "A legitimate recovery driver will have goods in transit insurance covering your vehicle while in their care. Always confirm this before allowing them to recover your car. Your own insurance doesn't typically cover damage during recovery."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can a recovery driver reach me in Birmingham?",
        "answer": "Most reputable local recovery drivers aim for 30-60 minute response times for emergency callouts in Birmingham. Response times may be longer during peak hours, bad weather, or if you're in a remote area. Always ask for an ETA when you call."
