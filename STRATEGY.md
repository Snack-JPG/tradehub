# TradeHub — Strategy & Direction

## The Vision

TradeHub is a local trades directory and website platform that helps tradespeople get found online — by Google, by AI assistants, and by customers. We build websites, list businesses on our directory, and optimise everything so that when someone's pipe bursts at 2am and they ask ChatGPT for help, our listed tradespeople are the answer.

## Why This Works

### The Problem
- Hundreds of thousands of UK tradespeople have no website or a terrible one
- They're invisible to Google, invisible to AI, and losing jobs to competitors who show up online
- They're too busy working to sort it themselves
- Web agencies charge £2-5k and take weeks
- Checkatrade charges £500+/year just for a listing
- **Nobody is optimising for AI search** — not Checkatrade, not Yell, not MyBuilder, not Bark, not TrustATrader (we checked — zero llms.txt across all of them)

### The Solution
- Professional website built and ready before we even call them
- Listed on tradehub.directory for free (included with website)
- Full AI SEO — schema markup, llms.txt, structured data
- Uptime monitoring and hosting included
- £400 one-off + £30/month. No contracts. They own the site.

### Why It Compounds
- Every client we add makes the directory stronger (more content, more authority)
- Stronger directory = better rankings = more leads for existing clients
- Happy clients refer other tradespeople (different trades, no competition)
- Referral incentive: refer 1 person → free hosting for a year
- Tradespeople know tradespeople. Plumber → electrician → roofer → builder.

## The Unfair Advantage

### AI SEO Gap (Confirmed Jan 30, 2026)
We checked every major UK trades platform:

| Platform | llms.txt | AI-optimised? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Checkatrade | ❌ No | Actively blocks emergency pages from crawlers |
| MyBuilder | ❌ 404 | No |
| Yell | ❌ Blocked | No |
| Bark | ❌ 404 | No |
| TrustATrader | ❌ 404 | No |
| RatedPeople | ❌ 404 | No |
| **TradeHub** | **✅ Built in** | **Yes — from day one** |

AI search is growing rapidly. People already ask ChatGPT/Gemini/Perplexity for emergency trade recommendations. This behaviour will only increase. We're building for where search is going, not where it's been.

### Speed Advantage
Using AI and automation (Claude Code, templates, structured data generators), we can produce in 15-20 minutes what agencies take 2-3 weeks to deliver. Our templates are premium quality with SEO baked in. The cost to deliver is near-zero. The margin is enormous.

### The TradeHub Brand
"I work for TradeHub" — we're not a freelancer cold calling. We're a platform. A directory. A legitimate business listing tradespeople. That framing changes the entire conversation:
- Sounds professional and established
- They're being "listed" not "sold to"
- Free directory listing = they feel like they're getting something
- The website is presented as part of the platform, not a standalone sale

## Revenue Model

| Stream | Price | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Website build | £200-500 one-off | Tiered by complexity. £400 sweet spot |
| Hosting + retainer | £30/month | Hosting (free on Vercel), uptime monitoring, minor updates |
| Directory listing | Free with website | Paid £10-20/mo for non-website clients later |
| Featured listing | £50/month | Top of category once traffic flows |
| Lead generation | £30-50/lead | Own the ranking, sell the leads. Endgame. |
| Google Ads mgmt | £150-300/month | Natural upsell for ambitious tradespeople |

### Revenue Projections

| Clients | Upfront (@ £400) | Monthly Recurring | Annual Recurring |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 10 | £4,000 | £300/mo | £3,600/yr |
| 20 | £8,000 | £600/mo | £7,200/yr |
| 50 | £20,000 | £1,500/mo | £18,000/yr |
| 100 | £40,000 | £3,000/mo | £36,000/yr |

Plus referral snowball — each client potentially brings 1-2 more.

## The Flywheel

```
Build website for tradesperson
        ↓
List them on tradehub.directory
        ↓
Their site gets backlink → ranks higher → more calls
Directory gets more content → ranks higher → more traffic
        ↓
Someone searches "electrician Solihull" → finds directory
        ↓
They call listed tradesperson → tradesperson sees value
        ↓
We call that tradesperson: "We sent you a lead, want a website too?"
        ↓
New client → new listing → directory gets stronger
        ↓
Client refers mate → another client → another listing
        ↓
REPEAT — every client makes every other client more valuable
```

## Emergency Trades — The Killer Niche

Emergency searches are the highest-intent, highest-value queries:
- "Emergency plumber Solihull"
- "Locksmith Birmingham 24 hour"  
- "Emergency electrician near me"

People in emergencies increasingly ask AI first. AI needs structured, parseable content with phone numbers. We build exactly that. Dedicated emergency landing pages on the directory with:
- Plain text answering "what to do if X happens"
- Tradesperson name and phone number
- Schema markup for emergency services
- FAQ sections AI can extract from
- llms.txt referencing all emergency services

Checkatrade literally blocks their emergency pages from crawlers. Wide open goal.

## What's Built (as of Jan 30, 2026)

- ✅ Website template (HTML + Tailwind, schema, llms.txt, mobile-first)
- ✅ Prospect list (30 businesses — Birmingham, Solihull, Redditch, Warwickshire)
- ✅ Trade website best practices research
- ✅ Uptime monitor v2 (dashboard, CLI, Telegram alerts, client management)
- ✅ Directory site scaffolded (Next.js 14, App Router, SEO, sample data)
- ✅ Business model, PRD, roadmap, pitch docs
- ✅ Cold call scripts and objection handling

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Saturday Jan 31** — Start cold calling the prospect list
2. **Track everything** — close rate, objections, what works, what doesn't
3. **First 5 clients** — build their sites, list on directory, deploy everything
4. **Buy domain** — tradehub.directory (£26)
5. **Deploy directory** — even with just 5 listings, it's live and building authority
6. **Start referral loop** — ask every client if they know someone
7. **Iterate** — adjust pricing, pitch, and template based on real feedback

## Long-Term Vision

TradeHub becomes THE local trades platform for AI-era discovery. While Checkatrade and Yell are still optimising for Google circa 2015, we're building for how people actually find tradespeople in 2026 and beyond — through AI assistants, voice search, and conversational queries.

The moat deepens with every client. The directory gets more authoritative. The AI recommendations get stronger. The leads flow. The referrals compound.

All Austin has to do is pick up the phone.
