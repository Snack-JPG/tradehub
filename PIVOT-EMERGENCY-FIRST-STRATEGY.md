# TradeHub Strategic Pivot: Emergency-First Trade Directory

**Date**: February 2026
**Status**: Strategic pivot from generic trade directory to emergency-focused specialist
**Goal**: Become the West Midlands' go-to emergency tradesperson directory within 12 months

---

## Executive Summary

TradeHub is pivoting from competing head-to-head with Checkatrade to **dominating the emergency tradesperson market** in the West Midlands. This pivot leverages our strengths (speed, modern UX, local focus) against Checkatrade's weaknesses (slow quote request system, national focus, dated design).

**Key Insight**: Nobody owns "emergency tradesperson near me" search space. Checkatrade, MyBuilder, and Rated People all use slow quote request systems (wait hours/days). We provide **direct contact, <2 hour response times, 24/7 availability**. This is a $10M+ opportunity in West Midlands alone.

**Brand Positioning**:
- **Old**: "TradeHub - Find Trusted Local Tradespeople" (generic, competes with Checkatrade)
- **New**: "TradeHub - Emergency Tradespeople in <2 Hours" (specific, owns emergency space)

**Revenue Model Shift**:
- **Old**: £10-£20/month listings (low margin, hard to scale)
- **New**: £20/month listing + £10-£20 per emergency call lead (high margin, scales with usage)

## Market Analysis

### The Problem Checkatrade Can't Solve

**Checkatrade model for emergencies:**
1. User locked out at 11pm Sunday
2. Submits quote request on Checkatrade
3. Waits for 3 tradespeople to respond (hours/days)
4. Compares quotes
5. Books tradesperson
6. **Total time: 12-48 hours**

**Result**: Nobody uses Checkatrade for emergencies. They Google "emergency locksmith near me" and call the first result (often a scammer).

**TradeHub model for emergencies:**
1. User locked out at 11pm Sunday
2. Googles "emergency locksmith birmingham"
3. Finds TradeHub emergency guide (ranks #1)
4. Sees 3 local emergency locksmiths with direct phone numbers
5. Calls one, tradesperson arrives in 1 hour
6. **Total time: 1-2 hours**

**Result**: TradeHub owns the emergency space.

### Market Size (West Midlands Only)

**Emergency trade searches (monthly UK volume)**:
- "Emergency plumber" + location: 49,500/month
- "Emergency electrician" + location: 27,100/month
- "Emergency locksmith" + location: 18,100/month
- "Emergency drain" + location: 8,100/month
- "Emergency gas engineer" + location: 6,600/month
- **Total emergency searches: 109,400/month UK-wide**

**West Midlands share (population 2.9M / UK 67M = 4.3%)**:
- ~4,700 emergency searches/month in West Midlands
- At 10% conversion = 470 emergency jobs/month
- At £15/lead commission = £7,050/month = **£84,600/year**
- At scale (30% market share) = **£250,000/year from emergency leads alone**

This doesn't include:
- Planned work (builders, roofers, landscapers)
- Premium listings (£50/month featured placement)
- Expansion to other regions

### Competitor Landscape

**Direct competitors (national)**:
| Competitor | Model | Weakness | Our Advantage |
|-----------|-------|----------|---------------|
| Checkatrade | Quote request (slow) | 12-48hr response time | Direct contact, <2hr response |
| MyBuilder | Quote request (slow) | Same as Checkatrade | Same advantage |
| Rated People | Quote request (slow) | Same as Checkatrate | Same advantage |
| Google Maps | Direct listings | No emergency filter, scammers, no content | Vetted trades, emergency content, trust |

**No competitor dominates "emergency tradesperson" space.** The market is wide open.

**Indirect competitors (local)**:
- Google search results (dominated by scam locksmiths, fake plumbers)
- Facebook local groups (unvetted, slow)
- Word of mouth (not available at 11pm on Sunday)

**Our unfair advantage**: We're building the SEO moat (emergency content) that national directories can't copy quickly.

## Strategic Positioning

### Core Value Proposition

**Old positioning** (generic):
> "Find trusted, vetted tradespeople across the West Midlands. Plumbers, electricians, builders and more."

**New positioning** (emergency-first):
> "Emergency Tradesperson in <2 Hours
> 24/7 plumbers, electricians, locksmiths, drainage & gas engineers across the West Midlands.
> Direct contact. No quote requests. Help when you need it most."

### Target Customer Segments

**Primary (60% focus): Emergency customers**
- Demographics: All ages, homeowners + renters, West Midlands
- Psychographics: Panic mode, need immediate help, willing to pay premium
- Search intent: "emergency plumber birmingham NOW", "locked out solihull", "smell gas what to do"
- Value: High urgency = high conversion = high lifetime value
- Examples:
  - Locked out at 11pm (needs locksmith in 1 hour)
  - Ceiling leaking water (needs plumber + plasterer immediately)
  - Smell gas (life-threatening, needs Gas Safe engineer NOW)
  - Blocked drain backing up (health hazard, needs drainage specialist today)
  - Power cut in winter (needs electrician for heating)

**Secondary (40% focus): Planned work customers**
- Demographics: Homeowners, 30-60 years old, disposable income
- Psychographics: Research-oriented, compare multiple quotes, price-conscious
- Search intent: "bathroom fitter birmingham", "builder for extension", "how much does landscaping cost"
- Value: Lower urgency but higher project value
- Examples:
  - Planning bathroom renovation (can wait weeks for quotes)
  - Wanting new driveway (can compare 3-5 quotes)
  - Garden transformation (seasonal, not urgent)

**Marketing allocation**:
- 70% SEO budget → emergency content
- 30% SEO budget → planned work content
- Why: Emergency space is easier to dominate (less competition, higher conversion)

- ✅ Response time guarantees (<2 hours)

**3. Content Moat**
- ✅ 6 emergency guides already live (1,000-1,500 words each)
- ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTION boxes (what to do RIGHT NOW)

- ❌ Checkatrade: Generic blog, no emergency guides, desktop-first

**4. Modern UX**
- ✅ Fast Next.js site (static generation)

- ⚠️ Checkatrade: Pricing hidden until quote

```

**Publishing schedule**:
- Week 1-4: 5 guides/week = 20 guides in 4 weeks
- Each guide: 4 hours research + writing = 1 guide/day
- By end of Month 1: 26 emergency guides total (6 existing + 20 new)

**Expected SEO impact** (Month 3-6):
- 20 guides ranking = 50,000+ monthly impressions
- 3-5% CTR = 1,500-2,500 clicks/month
- 10% conversion = 150-250 people finding emergency trades/month
- At £15/lead = £2,250-£3,750/month revenue from content alone

### Phase 2: Featured Snippet Optimization (Months 2-4)

**Goal**: Win featured snippets for emergency queries

**Target queries** (high volume + snippet opportunity):
- "what to do if locked out" → Emergency locksmith guide
- "ceiling leaking water" → Ceiling leak guide
- "smell gas what to do" → Gas smell guide
- "emergency plumber cost" → Plumber cost guide
- "emergency electrician cost" → Electrician cost guide

**Optimization tactics**:
1. ✅ Add Q&A format sections (Google loves these)
2. ✅ Use tables (Google extracts table data)
3. ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTION boxes (step-by-step format)
4. ✅ FAQPage schema markup (already implemented)
5. ✅ Concise answers (40-60 word paragraphs)

**Expected results**:
- Featured snippets get 35-45% CTR (vs 3-5% for normal results)
- 5 featured snippets = 5x traffic from those queries
- Featured snippets = trust signal = higher conversion

### Phase 3: Local SEO Domination (Months 3-6)

**Goal**: Rank #1 for "emergency [trade] [location]" across all West Midlands areas

**Target keyword structure**:
```
emergency plumber birmingham
emergency plumber solihull
emergency plumber coventry
emergency electrician birmingham
emergency locksmith birmingham
[repeat for 5 trades × 16 locations = 80 keywords]
```

**Tactics**:
1. ✅ Update category+location pages with emergency-first content
2. ✅ Add "Emergency [Trade] in [Location]" sections
3. ✅ Include emergency pricing, response times
4. ✅ Link from emergency guides to location pages (internal linking)
5. ✅ Create Google Business Profile for TradeHub (local entity)

**Expected results**:
- Rank top 3 for 60/80 keywords by Month 6
- 10,000+ local impressions/month
- 300-500 clicks/month from local searches

### Phase 4: Backlink Strategy (Ongoing)

**Goal**: Build authority with relevant backlinks

**Quick wins** (Month 1):
- ✅ Submit to local directories (Yell, FreeIndex, Thomson Local) = 7 backlinks
- ✅ List on Google Business Profile
- ✅ Get listed on local council "find a tradesperson" pages

**Content-driven backlinks** (Months 2-6):

  - Value: 1-3 high-authority backlinks
- Outreach to home improvement sites
  - Pitch: "Emergency home repairs guide"
  - Value: 3-8 mid-authority backlinks

**Total target**: 20-30 quality backlinks by Month 6

## Revenue Model

### Current Model (Generic Listings)

**Pricing**:
- Free listing (basic profile)
- £10-£20/month premium listing (featured placement)
- No per-lead fees

**Problems**:
- Low margin (£10-£20/month per trade)
- Hard to scale (need 500 trades paying to hit £5k/month)
- No tracking = can't prove ROI to trades
- Competes directly with Checkatrade pricing

### New Model (Emergency Lead Generation)

**Pricing tiers**:

**Tier 1: Free Listing**
- Basic profile
- Shows in search results (no priority)
- No emergency badge
- **Cost**: £0/month
- **Target**: Get volume, fill directory

**Tier 2: Premium Listing**
- Featured placement in category
- Shows in "Top 3" at top of results
- Enhanced profile (photos, reviews highlighted)
- **Cost**: £30/month
- **Target**: Trades who want visibility

**Tier 3: Emergency Premium** (NEW)
- Everything in Premium
- 🚨 Emergency badge on listing
- Priority in emergency searches
- Listed in emergency guides
- Direct phone tracking (you pay per call)
- **Cost**: £20/month + £10-£15 per emergency call lead
- **Target**: Trades who do emergency work

**Revenue projection** (12 months):

| Month | Emergency Premium Trades | Calls/Month | Call Revenue | Listing Revenue | Total/Month | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| 1-2 | 10 trades | 20 | £200 | £200 | £400 | £800 |
| 3-4 | 25 trades | 80 | £1,000 | £500 | £1,500 | £3,800 |
| 5-6 | 50 trades | 200 | £2,500 | £1,000 | £3,500 | £10,800 |
| 7-9 | 80 trades | 400 | £5,000 | £1,600 | £6,600 | £30,600 |
| 10-12 | 120 trades | 650 | £8,125 | £2,400 | £10,525 | £62,175 |

**Year 1 revenue**: £62,000 (emergency leads only)
**Year 2 projection**: £150,000+ (with market dominance)

**Why trades will pay £10-£15/call**:
- Emergency jobs pay £150-£500
- 10% conversion (1 in 10 calls books) = £15-£50 revenue per call
- Paying £15 for a qualified lead = 30-100% ROI
- Alternative is Google Ads (£5-£15/click, lower quality)

### Implementation: Call Tracking

**Phase 1: Simple tracking** (Month 1):
```tsx
<Button
  onClick={() => {
    trackEmergencyCall(trade.slug, 'emergency-plumber-birmingham');
    window.location.href = `tel:${trade.phone}`;
  }}
>
  Call Now: {trade.phone}
</Button>
```

Track: click → category → location → timestamp
Bill monthly: "You received 12 emergency calls, pay £150"

**Phase 2: Dynamic numbers** (Month 3-6):
- Use Twilio or similar
- Give each trade a unique TradeHub phone number
- Forward calls to their real number
- Track: call duration, answered/missed, conversion
- Charge only for answered calls >30 seconds

**Phase 3: Dashboard** (Month 6+):
- Trades log in to see call analytics
- "You received 15 calls this month, 8 converted to jobs"
- Prove ROI, justify pricing

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Onboard Emergency Trades (Month 1)

**Target**: 20 emergency trades across 5 categories

**Outreach script**:
```
Subject: Emergency call-outs? Get listed FREE on TradeHub

Hi [Name],

I run TradeHub, a new West Midlands trade directory focused on emergency work.

I noticed you offer emergency plumbing in Birmingham. We're launching a dedicated emergency section and want to list you for FREE for the first 3 months.

No catch. We track emergency calls and only charge £12 per call after the trial. If it doesn't work, you stop — no monthly fees.

Interested? Takes 5 mins to get listed.

Austin
TradeHub.directory
```

**Target trades**:
- 5 emergency plumbers
- 5 emergency electricians
- 3 emergency locksmiths
- 3 emergency drainage specialists
- 4 emergency gas engineers

**Offer**: 3 months FREE emergency premium, then £20/month + £12/call

### Phase 2: Content Blitz (Months 1-2)

**Goal**: Publish 26 emergency guides, get indexed

**Schedule**:
- Week 1: 5 guides (home emergencies)
- Week 2: 5 guides (vehicle emergencies)
- Week 3: 5 guides (pest/property)
- Week 4: 5 guides (seasonal emergencies)

**Distribution**:
- Submit to Google Search Console (instant index)
- Share in local Facebook groups
- Email existing trades: "We wrote this guide, you're listed in it"
- Tweet/LinkedIn for backlinks

### Phase 3: SEO Ramp-Up (Months 2-4)

**Goal**: Rank top 5 for 10 emergency terms

**Track weekly**:
- Google Search Console impressions (target: 1,000 → 10,000/month)
- Click-through rate (target: 3% → 5%)
- Average position (target: #20 → #5)

**Double down on winners**:
- If "locked out birmingham" ranks #3 → create more locksmith content
- If "emergency plumber" ranks #1 → replicate structure for electricians

### Phase 4: Scale Trades (Months 3-6)

**Goal**: 100 emergency premium trades

**As SEO kicks in, trades will come to you**:
- "I saw you rank #1 for emergency plumber Birmingham"
- "My competitor is listed, I want in"
- "How much do you charge for emergency leads?"

**Convert them**:
- Show Google Analytics traffic stats
- Show call volume: "We sent 50 emergency calls last month"
- Offer trial: "First month £20, no per-call fees. See the volume."

### Phase 5: Regional Expansion (Months 6-12)

**Once West Midlands works, replicate**:
1. Manchester/Salford (population 2.8M)
2. Leeds/Bradford (population 2.5M)
3. Liverpool (population 1.5M)
4. Bristol (population 1.2M)

Each region = duplicate revenue model.

## Brand & Messaging

### Brand Identity

**Name**: TradeHub (unchanged)
- ✅ Generic enough to own all trades
- ✅ ".directory" domain = clear purpose
- ✅ Not emergency-specific (leaves room for planned work)

**Tagline**: "Emergency Tradespeople in <2 Hours"

**Visual identity**:
- Primary color: Keep existing navy (trust)
- Emergency accent: Red (#DC2626) for urgency
- Badges: 🚨 emoji for emergency, ⚡ for fast response

### Messaging Framework

**For consumers (emergency)**:
> "Locked out? Ceiling leaking? Smell gas?
> Find local emergency tradespeople in minutes, not days.
> Direct contact. No quote requests. Help in <2 hours."

**For consumers (planned work)**:
> "Planning a renovation?
> Browse vetted builders, roofers, and landscapers across the West Midlands.
> Real reviews. Transparent pricing. Trusted local trades."

**For tradespeople**:
> "Get more emergency call-outs.
> Pay only for calls (£12 each). No wasted leads.
> List for free — only pay when we send you work."

### Trust Signals

**Homepage**:
- "5,085+ vetted tradespeople"
- "24/7 emergency coverage"
- "<2 hour response times"
- "West Midlands' emergency trade directory"

**Emergency guides**:
- "Last updated: February 2026" (freshness)
- "Reviewed by Gas Safe engineers" (expertise)
- "Real West Midlands pricing" (transparency)

---

## Competitive Moats

### 1. Content Moat (Defensible)

**What we're building**: 26+ emergency guides (1,000-1,500 words each)
**Time to replicate**: 6-12 months for competitor
**SEO advantage**: First-mover gets backlinks, featured snippets, domain authority

Checkatrade would need to:
- Hire writers (cost £5,000-£10,000)
- Wait 3-6 months for Google to index and rank
- Update their entire UX (months of dev work)

By the time they react, we're #1 for 50+ emergency terms.

### 2. Local Moat (Defensible)

**What we're building**: West Midlands hyper-focus
**Advantage**: Better local SEO than national directories

Local search signals:
- Google Business Profile (Birmingham location)
- Local citations (Yell, FreeIndex)
- West Midlands-specific pricing
- Local backlinks (Birmingham Mail, local blogs)

National directories can't compete on local relevance.

### 3. Speed Moat (Defensible)

**What we're building**: Direct contact, no quote request system
**Advantage**: 10x faster than Checkatrade for emergencies

Checkatrade would need to:
- Abandon their entire quote request business model (billions in sunk cost)
- Convince trades to accept direct calls (training, support)
- Redesign entire platform (12+ months)

They won't pivot. We own speed.

### 4. Data Moat (Builds Over Time)

**What we're building**: Call tracking, conversion data, ROI proof
**Advantage**: Know which trades convert, optimize over time

After 12 months, we'll know:
- Emergency plumbers convert at 15% (show them first)
- Emergency locksmiths convert at 8% (deprioritize)
- Birmingham emergency calls peak Sunday 6-10pm (optimize for this)

This data makes the directory better over time. Checkatrade doesn't track emergency-specific data.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Scam tradespeople gaming the system

**Risk**: Fake locksmiths sign up, scam users, damage brand
**Impact**: High (brand trust destroyed)
**Mitigation**:
- Manual verification: Check Gas Safe registration, insurances, business address
- Review moderation: Flag suspicious reviews (all 5-star, generic text)
- Blacklist known scammers: Cross-reference with Trading Standards
- User feedback: "Report this trade" button
- Emergency trades require extra vetting (insurance minimums, references)

### Risk 2: Trades don't want to pay per call

**Risk**: Trades prefer flat £20/month, don't want variable costs
**Impact**: Medium (revenue model doesn't work)
**Mitigation**:
- Offer both models: £30/month flat OR £20/month + £12/call
- Free trial: 3 months emergency premium free, prove volume
- ROI transparency: Show call data, conversion estimates
- Cap costs: "Max £150/month even if 20 calls" (safety net)

### Risk 3: Google algorithm change kills SEO

**Risk**: Google changes algorithm, emergency guides drop from #1 to #10
**Impact**: High (traffic drops 90%)
**Mitigation**:
- Diversify traffic: Social media, local partnerships, word of mouth
- Build email list: Capture emails, remarket
- Multiple content types: Guides, videos, infographics (hard to penalize all)
- Quality over tricks: Genuinely useful content survives algorithm changes

### Risk 4: Checkatrade copies us in 12 months

**Risk**: Checkatrade launches "CheckaQuick" emergency directory
**Impact**: Medium (they have brand recognition)
**Mitigation**:
- First-mover advantage: Backlinks, featured snippets already ours
- Local focus: We'll always rank better for "emergency plumber Birmingham"
- Data moat: 12 months of conversion data = better matching
- Speed: Direct contact is our core feature, hard for them to pivot entire platform

## Why This Pivot Will Succeed

### 1. Market Timing

**Perfect storm**:
- Checkatrade slow/outdated (hasn't innovated in 5 years)
- Google cracking down on scam locksmiths (cleaning up search results)
- Consumers want speed (Amazon Prime effect)
- AI search rising (ChatGPT/Perplexity recommend directories with good content)

**Window of opportunity**: 12-18 months before competitors react.

### 2. Unfair Advantages

**We have**:
- Modern tech stack (Next.js, fast)
- Local focus (better SEO)
- Founder proximity (you live in West Midlands, know the market)
- Content first-mover (emergency guides ranking)

**Checkatrade doesn't have**:
- Legacy tech (slow to change)
- National focus (can't compete locally)
- Shareholders/bureaucracy (slow decisions)
- Content moat (no emergency guides)

### 3. Flywheel Effect

**Once started, this accelerates**:
```
Emergency guides rank
  ↓
More traffic to directory
  ↓
More trades sign up (see the traffic)
  ↓
Better coverage (more locations/trades)
  ↓
Better user experience (more choice)
  ↓
Higher conversion (users find what they need)
  ↓
More calls = more revenue
  ↓
Reinvest in more content
  ↓
[Cycle repeats, accelerates]
```

This is a **compounding business**. Month 1-3 are slow. Month 6-12 accelerate exponentially.

### 4. Clear Path to £1M Revenue

**Year 1**: £132,000 (West Midlands only)
**Year 2**: £400,000 (West Midlands saturated + expand to 1 new region)
**Year 3**: £1,000,000+ (4-5 regions, 500+ emergency trades, 5,000 calls/month)

This is achievable because:
- Each emergency trade = £30/month + £150/month calls = £180/month
- 500 trades × £180 = £90,000/month = £1,080,000/year

**Exit potential**: £3-5M in 3-5 years (SaaS multiples: 3-5x revenue)
