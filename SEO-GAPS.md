# TradeHub — SEO Gaps & Improvements

## Current SEO Status: Good Foundation, Missing the Content Moat

### What We Have (Solid) ✅
- Schema markup on every page type (LocalBusiness, BreadcrumbList, ItemList, Article)
- Proper meta titles/descriptions per page
- Canonical URLs + OpenGraph
- Sitemap covering 321 pages
- `llms.txt` for AI discoverability
- Clean URL structure (`/plumbers/solihull`)
- Breadcrumbs
- Blog with 3 articles + Article schema
- Emergency landing pages (48 pages)
- FAQ schema on blog posts

### What the Top Directories Do That We Don't (Yet)

---

## 1. 🚨 Thin Content Risk — Category+Location Pages (CRITICAL)

The biggest issue. We have **208 category+location combo pages** but many have 0-1 listings, and the "SEO content block" at the bottom is the same template text with the city name swapped. Google explicitly penalises this — Sterling Sky documented manual penalties for exactly this pattern.

**What Checkatrade/TrustATrader do differently:**
- Only generate location pages where they actually have listings
- Each page has unique intro copy about that trade in that specific area
- They include local context (average prices in that area, local regulations, etc.)

**Fix:** Either suppress pages with <2 listings, or add genuinely unique content per page (local tips, area-specific pricing, nearby area links).

## 2. 💰 Cost Guides — Checkatrade's Secret Weapon

Checkatrade's blog is dominated by **"How much does X cost?"** pages. These are their biggest organic traffic drivers because:
- High search volume ("how much does a plumber cost" = thousands of searches/month)
- They naturally link to directory listings
- Google loves helpful, specific pricing data
- They rank for informational AND transactional queries

**We should build cost guide articles:**
- "How much does a plumber cost in 2026?"
- "How much does a new boiler cost? (2026 guide)"
- "Emergency locksmith prices — what to expect"
- "How much does plastering cost per room?"
- "Roof repair costs UK — complete guide"
- "Painter and decorator prices — what you'll pay"
- "How much does a new fence cost?"
- "Electrician costs UK — hourly rates and job prices"

---

## 3. ❓ FAQ Sections Per Category Page

Checkatrade and MyBuilder both have FAQ sections on their category pages. These:
- Win FAQ rich snippets in Google (expandable answers in search results)
- Add unique, helpful content that prevents thin page penalties
- Target long-tail questions people actually search

**Examples per trade:**
- **Plumbers:** "How quickly can an emergency plumber arrive?" / "Do I need a Gas Safe plumber for a boiler?" / "How much does a plumber charge per hour?"
- **Electricians:** "What's an EICR certificate?" / "Do I need Part P certification?" / "How much does a rewire cost?"
- **Roofers:** "How often should I get my roof inspected?" / "What's the difference between felt and GRP flat roofing?"
- **Builders:** "Do I need planning permission for an extension?" / "How long does a loft conversion take?"
- **Locksmiths:** "What should I do if I'm locked out?" / "How much does an emergency locksmith cost at night?"
- **Gas Engineers:** "How often should I get my boiler serviced?" / "What is a Gas Safety Certificate?"
- **Plasterers:** "How long does plaster take to dry?" / "Should I plaster or plasterboard?"
- **Painters:** "How much does it cost to paint a room?" / "Should I use emulsion or eggshell?"
- **Landscapers:** "When is the best time to lay a patio?" / "How much does a new garden cost?"
- **Carpenters:** "How much does a fitted kitchen cost?" / "Do I need a carpenter or a joiner?"
- **Tilers:** "How much does bathroom tiling cost?" / "Can you tile over existing tiles?"
- **Fencing:** "How much does a new fence cost per metre?" / "Do I need my neighbour's permission to put up a fence?"
- **Handymen:** "What jobs can a handyman do?" / "How much does a handyman charge per hour?"

## 4. 🔗 Internal Linking Strategy

The big directories aggressively cross-link. Our current internal linking is minimal — mostly just breadcrumbs and nav.

**What to add:**
- **Blog posts → category pages → profiles** (e.g., cost guide links to category page which links to profiles)
- **Category pages → related categories** ("Need a plumber? You might also need an electrician for your bathroom refit")
- **Location pages → nearby location pages** ("Also serving Knowle, Dorridge, Shirley...")
- **Profile pages → back to category and location pages**
- **Emergency pages → related non-emergency category pages**

---

## 5. 📊 "How to Hire" Guide Per Trade

TrustATrader and Checkatrade both have "how to find a good [trade]" content per category. This serves dual purpose:
- Ranks for informational searches ("how to find a good plumber")
- Builds trust with homeowners (shows authority, not just a listing site)

**Add a "How to choose" section to each category page covering:**
- What qualifications/accreditations to look for
- Questions to ask before hiring
- Red flags to watch out for
- What to expect price-wise

---

## 6. 🏆 Trust Signals That Google Can See

What the big players have that we don't:
- **Review counts in title tags** — Checkatrade: "Find 43+ Plumbers in Solihull". We should do "Find 3+ Trusted Plumbers in Solihull"
- **Aggregate review data in schema** — showing total reviews across all listed trades on category pages
- **Last updated dates** — signals freshness to Google
- **"Verified" or "Checked" badges** — builds E-E-A-T signals

---

## 7. 📍 Google Business Profile

TradeHub itself needs a Google Business Profile. This:
- Makes us show up in Maps for "trades directory [area]"
- Gives us a place to collect reviews about the directory itself
- Builds entity recognition with Google

*(Manual task — can't be automated)*
