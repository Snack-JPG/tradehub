**Last Updated:** 4th February 2026

**Time Per Customer:** 1-2 hours setup, 30 mins/month maintenance
**Charge:** £200 one-time OR £600 + £80/month (Pro Package)

## 🎯 Why GMB Matters (Your Pitch to Customers)

**The Stats:**
- 46% of all Google searches are LOCAL ("plumber near me", "emergency electrician")
- 76% of people who search on mobile visit a business within 24 hours
- GMB listings appear ABOVE websites in search results (especially mobile)
- 88% of searches for local businesses result in a call or visit within 24 hours

**The Reality:**
- Most tradespeople have claimed their GMB but done NOTHING with it
- Incomplete profiles rank lower
- No photos = no trust = no calls
- Not asking for reviews = invisible

**Your Pitch:**
> "Your website is great, but 75% of people find you through Google Maps,
> not your website. Your Google Business Profile is incomplete right now -
> let me optimize it and you'll see 2-3x more calls within 2 weeks."

---

## ✅ PHASE 1: Initial Setup & Claim (30-60 mins)

### Step 1: Find or Create the Listing

**If they already have a listing:**
1. Google their business name + location
2. Click "Own this business?" or "Claim this business"
3. Follow verification process (usually postcard to address)
4. Wait 5-7 days for verification code

**If they DON'T have a listing:**
1. Go to https://business.google.com
2. Click "Manage now"
3. Sign in with their Google account (or create one)
4. Enter business name
5. Choose category (Primary: "Plumber" / "Electrician" / etc)
6. Add location (if they have a storefront) OR service area
7. Add phone number
8. Submit for verification

**IMPORTANT:**
- Use THEIR email/Google account, not yours
- They need to verify via postcard (5-7 days)
- You can start optimizing before verification completes

**Tools needed:**
- Their business email
- Access to their mail (for verification postcard)
- Their phone number

---

### Step 2: Choose the Right Categories

**Primary Category (MOST IMPORTANT):**
- Choose the MOST specific category
- Examples:
  - "Emergency plumber" (if they do emergency)
  - "Plumber" (if general)
  - "Heating contractor" (if mainly heating)
  - "Electrician"
  - "Drainage service"

**Secondary Categories (Add 2-5):**
- Add related services
- Examples for plumber:
  - "Boiler supplier"
  - "Heating contractor"
  - "Water heater repair service"
  - "Bathroom remodeler"
  - "Drain cleaning service"

**Why this matters:**
- Categories determine what searches you appear for
- "Emergency plumber" appears for "emergency plumber near me"
- "Plumber" appears for "plumber near me"
- More relevant categories = more visibility

**Common mistake:**
- ❌ Choosing generic category when specific exists
- ❌ Not using secondary categories (missing out on visibility)

---

### Step 3: Complete Business Information (100% Completion)

**Business Name:**
- Use EXACT legal name
- ❌ DON'T add keywords (Google will penalize)
- ✅ "City Electrical Services"
- ❌ "City Electrical Services - Emergency Electrician Birmingham"

**Address:**
- If storefront: Enter full address
- If home-based/mobile: Hide address, show service area only

**Service Area:**
- Add all cities/postcodes they serve
- Be specific: "Birmingham B13, B14, B15" not just "Birmingham"
- Add up to 20 service areas

**Phone Number:**
- Use LOCAL number (not 0800)
- Same number everywhere online (consistency)
- Mobile is fine (especially for trades)

**Website:**
- Add their new website you built
- Make sure it works and loads fast

**Hours:**
- Add ACCURATE hours
- If 24/7 emergency: Mark as "Open 24 hours"
- Add special hours (closed on bank holidays, etc)

**Business Description (750 characters max):**

**Template:**

**Categories to cover:**
- At work (them doing the job)
- Completed projects (before/after)

**Where to get photos:**

**Photo tips:**

- ✅ Mix of action shots + completed work
- ✅ Include faces (builds trust)
- ✅ Show branded van (professionalism)
- ❌ Don't use blurry/low quality
- ❌ Don't use stock photos that look too fake

**How to upload:**

- Add to relevant categories (At Work, Team, Identity)

---

### 4. Video (Optional but POWERFUL)
- 30-second intro video
- Customer testimonial video
- Time-lapse of job completion

**If they have video:**
- Upload to YouTube first
- Then add to GMB

**Why this matters:**
- Listings with video get 5x more calls
- Very few tradespeople have video (easy win)

---

## ✅ PHASE 4: Get Reviews (ONGOING)

**The most important ranking factor**

**Current reviews:**
- If they have 10-25 reviews: Goal is 50+ (2-3x visibility)
- If they have 25-50 reviews: Goal is 100+ (authority status)

**How to get more reviews:**

### Method 1: Direct Link (Easiest)
1. Find their Google review link:
   - Go to their GMB listing
   - Click "Share" → "Share review form"
   - Copy link: `https://g.page/r/[CODE]/review`
2. Create short link: Use bit.ly or their domain
   - Example: `brumheatandplumb.co.uk/review` → redirects to Google review link
3. After completing job, send SMS:

**SMS Template:**
```
Hi [Name], thanks for using [Business Name] today!

We'd really appreciate a quick Google review if you were
happy with our service: [short link]

Takes 30 seconds - helps us massively.

Thanks!
[Name]
```

---

### Method 2: QR Code (For in-person)
1. Generate QR code from their review link
2. Print on business cards/invoices
3. Say: "If you're happy with the service, scan this to leave us a review"

---

### Method 3: Automated System (What you charge £30/month for)
**Tools needed:**
- Zapier (free tier works)
- Google Forms
- Twilio (SMS) - £0.04 per SMS

**How it works:**
1. After job, tradesperson fills out 2-min form:
   - Customer name
   - Customer phone number
   - Job completed? (Yes/No)
2. Zapier triggers:
   - Wait 2 hours
   - Send SMS with review link
3. Customer gets text, leaves review

**Setup (if offering as service):**
- Takes 2 hours to set up first time
- Copy template for each customer after that
- Charge £150 setup + £30/month

---

### Responding to Reviews (CRITICAL)
**Respond to EVERY review within 24 hours**

**5-star review response template:**
```
Thanks so much [Name]! Really appreciate you taking the time to
leave us a review. It was great to help you with [the boiler
repair / emergency plumbing / etc]. Don't hesitate to call if
you need anything else!

[Business Name]
```

```
Hi [Name], thanks for the feedback. I'm sorry we didn't meet
your expectations with [issue]. I'd love to discuss this further
and make it right. Please give me a call on [phone number].

[Business Name]
```

**Why this matters:**
- Responding to reviews boosts ranking

## 🎯 How to Pitch This on Calls

### When they ask "How much?"

**OLD RESPONSE:**
"£300 for website and directory listing"

**NEW RESPONSE:**
```
"We've got two options:

Basic is £300 - website and directory listing. Gets you online.

Pro is £600 setup and £80/month - includes everything in Basic
PLUS Google Business Profile optimization and monthly management.

Here's why Pro matters: 75% of people searching for emergency
plumbers find you through Google Maps, not your website. Your
GMB is probably incomplete right now - no posts, not many photos,
not optimized.

I'll fully optimize it and manage it monthly with regular posts
and review responses. You'll see 2-3x more calls within 2 weeks.

Most people go for Pro because Google Maps is where the leads
actually come from. Which sounds better for you?"
```

---

### When they're hesitant about monthly fee:

**YOU:**
```
"I get it - but think about it this way: if optimizing your
Google Maps listing gets you just ONE extra job per month,
that's £100-500 in revenue.

You're paying me £80/month and getting £100-500 back. Plus
you're building long-term visibility - more reviews, higher
rankings, consistent posts.

It's the best ROI marketing you can do."
```

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
1. Add keywords to business name ("Joe's Plumbing - Emergency Plumber Birmingham")
   - Google will suspend listing
   - Use exact legal name only

2. Use fake reviews or buy reviews
   - Google detects and removes them
   - Can get listing suspended

3. Stuff keywords in description
   - Write naturally
   - Keywords are fine, but don't overdo it

4. Use stock photos only
   - Mix stock with real photos
   - Real photos perform better

5. Ignore reviews
   - Respond to EVERY review
   - Shows you're active

6. Set incorrect hours
   - Customers show up when you're closed
   - Damages trust

### ✅ DO:
1. Keep NAP consistent (Name, Address, Phone)
   - Same everywhere online
   - Google checks this

2. Post regularly (2-4 times per month)
   - Keeps listing "active"
   - Active listings rank higher

3. Add photos continuously
   - 2-5 new photos per month
   - Fresh photos = higher ranking

4. Get reviews consistently
   - 2-4 new reviews per month
   - Steady growth beats big spikes

5. Respond to reviews within 24 hours
   - Shows engagement
   - Boosts ranking
