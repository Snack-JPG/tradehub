# TradeHub Sales Workflow
## Build-On-Demand Website Sales System

**Last Updated:** 4th February 2026
**Average Time Per Site:** 20 minutes
**Target Price:** £200-300 setup + £10/month
**Target Close Rate:** 5-10% of calls

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**OLD WAY (Wasteful):**
- Pre-build sites → Hope someone wants them → Most don't care → Wasted time

**NEW WAY (Efficient):**
- Call first → Validate interest → Build only for YES responses → Higher conversion

**Key Principle:** Only build sites for people who have ALREADY said they want to see one.

---

## 📞 The Call Script

### Opening (First 10 Seconds)
```
"Hi [Name], this is Austin from TradeHub - quick question,
do you have a website for your [plumbing/electrical/etc] business?"
```

**Wait for response** (Usually "No" or "Not yet")

### Value Prop (Next 15 Seconds)
```
"I thought so - I came across your Google listing and your
reviews are brilliant. I can put together a quick demo site
for you that showcases your 5-star rating, all your services,
click-to-call buttons - basically a proper professional site."
```

### The Ask (Critical Moment)
```
"Would you want to see what that looks like?"
```

**Pause and wait for response**

---

## 🔀 Response Handling

### ✅ If They Say YES ("Yeah sure" / "Go on then" / "Alright")

**Your Response:**
```
"Perfect - what's the best number to text or WhatsApp it to?
I'll get that over to you in the next hour or so and you
can have a look."
```

**What to collect:**
- ✅ Business name (confirm spelling)
- ✅ Main services (ask: "What are your main services so I can highlight them?")
- ✅ WhatsApp/Phone number for link
- ✅ Their actual name (for personalization)

**Before hanging up:**
```
"Brilliant, I'll get that built and sent over to you shortly.
Have a proper look when it comes through and let me know what
you think. Speak soon!"
```

**IMMEDIATELY:** Mark them as "BUILD QUEUE" in your tracking sheet

---

### ❌ If They Say NO ("Not interested" / "Too busy" / "Maybe later")

**Your Response:**
```
"No worries at all - if you change your mind, we're at
tradehub.directory. Best of luck with the business!"
```

**Then:** Move to next call. Don't waste time convincing.

---

### 🤔 If They Say MAYBE ("How much is it?" / "What's the catch?")

**Your Response:**
```
"No catch - the demo is completely free to look at. If you
like it and want it on your own domain with your branding,
it's £300 setup and £10 a month. But there's no obligation
to look at the demo."
```

**Then:**
```
"So do you want me to send it over so you can see the quality
of work, or would you rather leave it?"
```

**If YES:** Treat as ✅ above
**If NO:** Treat as ❌ above

---

### 💰 If They Ask Price First (Before Seeing Demo)

**Your Response:**
```
"Setup is £300 which covers custom design, Google reviews
integration, mobile optimization, SEO - everything. Then £10
a month for hosting and support. But let me send you the free
demo first so you can see what you'd actually be getting.
What's your WhatsApp?"
```

**Goal:** Get them to see the demo BEFORE price negotiation

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Pre-build sites before calling (waste of time)
- Send links to people who said NO
- Follow up more than 3 times
- Spend more than 20 mins per site
- Get discouraged by low response rates
- Call the same person twice in one week
- Build sites during calling time (context switching kills productivity)

### ✅ DO:
- Only build for people who said YES
- Follow up consistently (Day 2 and Day 3)
- Track everything in spreadsheet
- Batch your calling (morning/afternoon)
- Batch your building (midday/evening)
- Move fast (send link within 1 hour of building)
- Celebrate small wins (first response, first sale)

---

## 💡 Advanced Techniques

### The "Live Build" Close (Advanced)
**On the call:**
```
"Tell you what - I'm at my computer right now. Give me
your business name and services, I'll build it WHILE
we're talking and send you the link before we hang up."
```

**Then:**
- Keep them on phone
- Build in 20 mins while chatting
- Send link while still on call
- "Check your texts - just sent it"
- They open it LIVE
- Close on the spot

**Conversion rate:** 30-50% (vs 5-10% normal)

---

### The "Urgency" Play
**When they say "let me think about it":**
```
"No problem - just so you know, I'm only taking on
3 new clients this week and I've got 2 spots left.
If you want it, let me know by tomorrow and I'll
prioritize you."
```

**Why it works:** Creates scarcity and deadline

---

### The "Competitor" Play
**During the call:**
```
"I saw [Competitor Name] has a website but yours is
so much better. Your reviews are 5 stars vs their
4.2. A proper site would really highlight that."
```

**Why it works:** Makes it competitive, not just "nice to have"

---

## 📈 Optimization Over Time
