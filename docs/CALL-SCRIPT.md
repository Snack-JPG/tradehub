# TradeHub Cold Call Script
## The "No Subscription, More Leads" Pitch

**Last Updated:** 4th February 2026
**Conversion Target:** 8-15% (demo requests)
**Close Target:** 15-25% (of demos sent)

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Lead with authority** - You're from TradeHub (established directory), not a freelancer
2. **Qualify fast** - If they don't need customers, end the call in 30 seconds
3. **Sell outcomes, not products** - "5x more leads" not "a website"
4. **Challenge soft nos** - Make them justify rejection
5. **Build on demand** - Only build sites for people who say YES

---

## 📞 THE SCRIPT

### Opening (5 seconds)

```
"Hi [Name], this is Austin from TradeHub - we run a directory
of tradespeople in the West Midlands. Quick question: do you
currently have a website for your [plumbing/electrical/etc]
business?"
```

**WAIT FOR RESPONSE**

---

### If They Say "YES, I have a website"

**YOU:**
```
"Ah brilliant - is it getting you online leads or mainly
just for credibility?"
```

**If "Getting leads":**
```
"Perfect, sounds like you're sorted then. Best of luck!"
```
**[END CALL - 30 seconds]**

**If "Just for credibility" or "Not really getting leads":**
```
"Got it - so you COULD use more online customers then?
Industry research shows modern sites with click-to-call
and reviews get 5x more conversions. Want me to show you
what that could look like for your business?"
```

**[If YES → Go to DEMO OFFER]**
**[If NO → Go to QUALIFICATION CHALLENGE]**

---

### If They Say "NO, I don't have a website"

**YOU:**
```
"Right - so industry research shows businesses with professional
websites get 5x more online leads than those without. We build
sites for tradespeople and list you on our directory for more
visibility."
```

**[Pause 2 seconds - let them process]**

**THEN:**
```
"Are you actually looking to get more customers online, or are
you already busy enough with the work you have?"
```

**CRITICAL: This is the QUALIFICATION moment. Listen carefully.**

---

## 🔀 RESPONSE PATHS

### PATH A: "I'm already busy enough" / "Got plenty of work"

**YOU (Positive close):**
```
"Brilliant! That's exactly where you want to be. If that ever
changes and you need more online leads, we're at tradehub.directory.
Best of luck with everything!"
```

**[END CALL - 45 seconds total]**

**Why this works:**
- ✅ You congratulated them (positive interaction)
- ✅ No time wasted (they're not a customer)
- ✅ Left door open (might call back later)
- ✅ Professional (not pushy)

**NEXT CALL IMMEDIATELY**

---

### PATH B: "Yeah, I could use more work" / "Sure" / "I'm interested"

**YOU (Demo offer):**
```
"Perfect - let me put together a quick demo of what your site
would look like. It'll showcase your Google reviews, all your
services, click-to-call functionality - basically everything
that converts visitors into phone calls.

I can have that over to you in the next hour or so. Want to
see it?"
```

**If YES:**
```
"Brilliant - what's the best number to WhatsApp it to?"
```

**[Collect WhatsApp/phone, confirm spelling of business name]**

**YOU:**
```
"Perfect - I'll get that built and sent over shortly. Have a
proper look when it comes through and let me know what you think.
No pressure at all - if you like it, we can chat about getting
you set up. Sound good?"
```

**[END CALL - Log as "BUILD QUEUE"]**

---

### PATH C: "Not really interested" / "Nah I'm alright"

**YOU (Challenge close - find the real objection):**
```
"Fair enough - can I ask, is that because you're already at
capacity with work, or just not prioritizing online leads right now?"
```

**If "Already busy":**
→ **Go to PATH A** (congratulate and end call)

**If "Just not interested" / "Don't see the point":**
```
"Got it - so you COULD use more customers, you just don't think
a website would help with that?"
```

**THEM (usually):**
"Well... I mean... maybe it could, I just don't know..."

**YOU (Re-engage):**
```
"That's exactly why I'm calling - most tradespeople don't realize
75% of emergency searches happen on mobile. If they can't find
you online with one click to call, they ring the competitor.

Let me send you a quick demo - no obligation. If you like it,
great. If not, just delete it. Takes 30 seconds to look at.
What's your WhatsApp?"
```

**[If YES → Collect number, build site]**
**[If still NO → "No worries, best of luck!" → END CALL]**

---

### PATH D: "How much is it?" (Before seeing demo)

**YOU:**
```
"It's £300 setup which covers the professional website, Google
reviews integration, mobile optimization, SEO, plus listing on
our directory. Then £10 a month for hosting and support.

But let me send you the demo first so you can see what you'd
actually be getting. Otherwise you're making a decision on
something you haven't seen yet. What's your WhatsApp?"
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ You answered the question (not evasive)
- ✅ Reframed to demo-first (they need to see value)
- ✅ Logical reasoning ("can't decide without seeing it")

**[Collect number, build site]**

---

## 💬 COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### Objection 1: "I don't need a website, I get all my work from word of mouth"

**YOU:**
```
"That's brilliant that word of mouth is working - but here's
the thing: 60% of people still check online even when they get
a recommendation. If they can't find you or your site looks
outdated, they call someone else instead.

Plus, what happens if word of mouth slows down? You've got
nothing to fall back on. This gives you a safety net. Want to
at least see what it could look like?"
```

---

### Objection 2: "I'm too busy to deal with this right now"

**YOU:**
```
"I completely get it - that's actually why I'm calling though.
You don't have to do anything. I build the demo, send it over,
you look at it for 30 seconds when you've got time.

If you like it, I handle the setup. If not, you've lost nothing.
What's your WhatsApp and I'll send it over?"
```

---

### Objection 3: "That's too expensive"

**YOU:**
```
"I get it - but think about it this way: £300 is literally
1-2 jobs for you, right? And this could get you 5-10 extra
jobs per month from online searches.

The math is pretty clear - you'd make it back in the first week.
Plus it's a one-time cost, not a subscription. Want to at least
see the demo before deciding?"
```

---

### Objection 4: "I'll think about it" / "Send me some info by email"

**YOU (This is a brush-off - challenge it):**
```
"Of course - but here's the thing: an email is just text, you're
not seeing anything concrete. A demo is way better because you
can actually SEE what your business would look like online.

Takes me an hour to build, takes you 30 seconds to look at.
Let me just send you the demo - if you don't like it, no worries.
What's your WhatsApp?"
```

---

### Objection 5: "My nephew/friend can do this cheaper"

**YOU:**
```
"Fair enough - but can I be honest? I've seen a LOT of sites
built by mates or family members. They look amateur, don't work
on mobile, and never get finished.

This is professional work: mobile-optimized, SEO setup, Google
reviews integrated, click-to-call buttons. Plus I get it done
in a week, not 'when they have time.'

Let me send you the demo - you can compare it to what your
nephew would do. If his is better, go with him. Fair?"
```

---

### Objection 6: "I already tried a website and it didn't work"

**YOU:**
```
"I hear that a lot - usually it's because the site wasn't
optimized for conversions. No click-to-call, didn't work on
mobile, no reviews shown.

Mine are specifically built for tradespeople to convert searches
into phone calls. That's why I say let me show you a demo - you'll
see the difference immediately. What's your WhatsApp?"
```

---

### Objection 7: "I need to speak to my wife/business partner first"

**YOU:**
```
"Totally understand - but you don't need to decide anything yet.
Let me send you the demo so you've got something concrete to
show them. Otherwise you're just describing an abstract idea.

I'll send it over, you show them, and if you both like it, we
can chat. Sound good? What's your WhatsApp?"
```

---

### Objection 8: "Can you call me back in a few weeks/months?"

**YOU (This is a brush-off - challenge it):**
```
"I could, but to be honest, if you're not looking for more
customers now, you probably won't be in a few weeks either.

Are you genuinely planning to sort this out later, or is this
just not a priority for you?"
```

**If "Not a priority":**
```
"Fair enough - best of luck!"
```
**[END CALL]**

**If "Actually will sort it":**
```
"Cool - let me send the demo now so when you're ready, you've
already seen it. What's your WhatsApp?"
```

---

## 🔄 THE REVERSAL TECHNIQUE (Advanced)

**Use this when they're giving soft nos but you sense they DO need customers:**

### The Takeaway

**YOU:**
```
"You know what, sounds like this isn't the right time for you.
No worries at all - I'll leave you to it. Best of luck with
the business!"
```

**[Pause - prepare to hang up]**

**THEM (50% of the time):**
"Wait, I didn't say I wasn't interested..."

**YOU (Re-engage):**
```
"Oh my bad - I just got the impression you weren't really looking
for more customers right now. Are you actually interested in
seeing what this could look like?"
```

**[Usually they'll say YES at this point because you took it away]**

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Reverse psychology (you're giving up, they want it back)
- ✅ Forces them to commit or reject clearly
- ✅ No more time-wasting "maybes"

---

## 📱 AFTER THE CALL - TEXT MESSAGE

**Send this immediately after building the site (within 1 hour):**

### WhatsApp/Text Message Template

```
Hi [Name], Austin from TradeHub here.

Just finished putting together that demo site for you:
[LINK]

Shows off your [5★ Google reviews / services / emergency
availability] and makes it super easy for customers to call you.

Have a look and let me know what you think 👍

No pressure - if you like it we can chat about getting you
set up properly.

Austin - TradeHub
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Sent within 1 hour (shows speed/professionalism)
- ✅ Personalized (mentions their specific business)
- ✅ Low pressure ("no pressure")
- ✅ Clear next step ("let me know what you think")

---

## 🔁 FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

### Day 1: Send demo
**[Send demo immediately after call]**

**DO NOT follow up same day** - let them look at it first

---

### Day 2 (Morning 9-10am): First follow-up

```
Morning [Name]!

Did you get a chance to check out that demo site I sent?

[link again]

Let me know what you think 👍

Austin
```

**Wait until evening for response**

---

### Day 3 (If no response): Challenge follow-up

```
Hi [Name],

Sent that demo a couple days ago - I'm guessing you're probably
too busy to look at it, which is fair enough.

If you're NOT too busy and could actually use more online leads,
have a quick look and let me know.

If you ARE too busy, no worries - I'll leave you to it 👍

Austin - TradeHub
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Challenges their silence ("I'm guessing you're too busy")
- ✅ Forces a response (they'll say "actually yeah I'll look" or "yeah too busy")
- ✅ Gets clarity (no more ghosting)

---

### Day 4 (If still no response): Final message

```
Hi [Name],

Last message from me - the demo site is here if you want to
use it: [link]

If not interested, no worries at all 👍

Austin
```

**After this: MARK AS DEAD, move on**

**DO NOT follow up more than 3 times** - you'll look desperate

---

## 💰 CLOSING THE SALE (When They Respond Positively)

### If they say "Looks good!" / "I like it"

**YOU:**
```
Brilliant! So it's £300 setup to get you on your own domain
(like yourcompany.co.uk) with your business email, then £10
a month for hosting and support.

I can have you fully live within 24 hours. Want to go ahead?
```

---

### If they say "How much again?"

**YOU:**
```
£300 setup which covers everything - custom design, your Google
reviews, mobile optimization, SEO, listing on our directory.
Then just £10/month for hosting.

This will pay for itself in 1-2 jobs. Shall I get you set up?
```

---

### If they say "Can you do it cheaper?"

**YOU:**
```
I could drop it to £250, but honestly at that point I'm barely
making anything. The value you're getting is easily £1,000+ if
you went to an agency.

£300 is literally 1-2 jobs for you, and this could get you
5-10 extra jobs per month. The ROI is pretty clear. Can we move
forward at £300?
```

**OR (if you want to hold firm):**
```
I'm already at the lowest price for this quality of work. My
time building it, the hosting, the support - £300 is genuinely
fair.

If price is the only concern, let's do this: I'll include the
first 3 months hosting free (£30 value). So you're only paying
£300 for the first 3 months total. That work for you?
```

---

### If they say "Let me think about it"

**YOU:**
```
Of course - but can I ask, what specifically do you need to
think about? Is it the price, or are you not convinced it'll
get you more customers?
```

**[Find the real objection, address it]**

**THEN:**
```
Look, I've only got 3 slots left this week. If you want it,
let me know by tomorrow and I'll prioritize you. Otherwise
I'll move on to the next person. Fair?
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Creates urgency (limited slots)
- ✅ Creates deadline (tomorrow)
- ✅ Shows you're in demand (moving on to others)

---

---

## 🔥 MINDSET REMINDERS

### Before You Start Calling

**Remember:**
1. ✅ You're offering genuine value (5x more leads is REAL)
2. ✅ You're from TradeHub (authority, not freelancer)
3. ✅ You're saving them time (you build it, not them)
4. ✅ You're solving a problem (invisible online = lost customers)
5. ✅ You have data (industry research backs you up)

**You're not begging. You're offering an opportunity.**

---

### During Calls

**Remember:**
- ✅ Every NO gets you closer to a YES (law of averages)
- ✅ Rejection isn't personal (they don't know you)
- ✅ Qualify fast (don't waste time on tire-kickers)
- ✅ Challenge soft nos (find the real objection)
- ✅ Move fast (next call within 1 minute)

**Speed + volume = success**

---

### After Rejections

**Remember:**
- ✅ You only need 2-3 YES responses per day to hit targets
- ✅ 50 calls = 10-15 demos = 2-3 sales = £600-900
- ✅ That's 4-6% conversion (industry standard is 2-3%)
- ✅ You're already better than average

**Trust the process. Trust the numbers.**

---

## 🎬 FINAL TIPS

### DO:
- ✅ Speak with confidence (you're from TradeHub, not a random)
- ✅ Qualify early (are you looking for more customers?)
- ✅ Challenge soft nos (make them justify rejection)
- ✅ Build on demand (only for YES responses)
- ✅ Follow up 2-3 times (most sales happen on follow-up)
- ✅ Move fast (next call within 60 seconds)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Beg or sound desperate
- ❌ Try to convince people who are busy (waste of time)
- ❌ Build sites for "maybes" (only build for YES)
- ❌ Follow up more than 3 times (you look desperate)
- ❌ Take rejection personally (it's just numbers)
- ❌ Slow down between calls (momentum matters)

---

## 🚀 SUCCESS MANTRA

**Before each call, repeat:**

> "I'm from TradeHub. I have data. I have a demo. They either need
> more customers or they don't. If they do, I can help. If they don't,
> next call."

**Then dial.**
