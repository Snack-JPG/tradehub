# TradeHub — Cold Call Script

## The Setup

Before calling, spend 5 minutes per prospect:
1. Check their Google listing — reviews, rating, photos, services
2. Duplicate the website template, swap in their details + reviews
3. Deploy to a preview link (e.g. ab-plastering.vercel.app)
4. Have the link ready to text/WhatsApp them during the call

## The Call

### Opening (10 seconds — don't lose them)

> "Hi, is that [NAME]? My name's Austin, I'm calling from TradeHub — we're a trades directory that helps local tradespeople get found online. I can see you've got [X] reviews on Google, all [RATING] stars — really impressive stuff. Quick question — do you have a website at the moment?"

**If NO website:**

> "That's actually why I'm calling. We've been listing top-rated tradespeople in [AREA] on our directory, and your reviews caught our eye. I've actually gone ahead and put together a website for you based on your Google profile — took me a look at your reviews, your services, and built it out. It's nothing you need to commit to, but can I send you the link to have a look? Takes 30 seconds."

**If YES (bad website):**

> "I had a look at your current one — and honestly, with the quality of your reviews, I think your website should match that. I've actually put together a modern version for you — loads faster, shows up better on Google and AI search. Can I send you the link to compare?"

**If YES (decent website):**

> "Nice one. I had a look — looks decent. The reason I'm calling is we're listing top-rated trades on our directory to help drive extra leads your way. It's free to be listed. Worth 2 minutes to get you set up?"

### Send the Link

> "What's the best number to WhatsApp it to? I'll send it now."

*Send the preview link immediately. Stay on the phone.*

> "Have a look when you get a sec — it's got your reviews on there, your services, click-to-call phone number. Works perfectly on mobile which is where most of your customers are finding you."

### The Value Drop

> "Here's the thing that's different about what we do — you know how more and more people are using ChatGPT and AI assistants? Like if someone's boiler breaks down, the first thing they do now is ask their phone 'who's a good plumber near me.' We build websites specifically so that AI recommends YOU. Checkatrade doesn't even do this — we checked. None of the big directories are set up for it. Your website would be."

### The Close

> "So to get this live on your own domain — [businessname].co.uk or whatever you want — it's a one-off £400. I sort everything: the domain, the hosting, the lot. No monthly contracts, you own the website. I also list you on our TradeHub directory for free, which gives you another place customers find you and boosts your Google ranking."

**If they hesitate on price:**

> "Tell you what — if you can do £400 today, I'll throw in the first 3 months of hosting free. After that it's £30 a month which covers hosting, uptime monitoring — I make sure your site never goes down — and any small updates you need. But honestly, one extra job from this pays for it ten times over, right?"

### The Referral Seed (plant this regardless of outcome)

> "One more thing — if you know any other tradesmen who could use a website, send them my way. If they sign up, your hosting is free for a whole year. So if you know a sparky or a roofer or anyone..."

## Objection Handling

### "I don't need a website, I get all my work through word of mouth"

> "That's brilliant — and your reviews prove it, people clearly love your work. The website isn't about replacing word of mouth — it's about what happens when someone gets your name recommended and then Googles you. Right now they find nothing, or just your Google listing. With a website, they see your reviews, your services, your phone number — and they call you with confidence. It's your digital business card."

### "My mate / nephew / daughter does my IT stuff"

> "Fair enough — and no disrespect to them. The difference is we specialise in trades websites specifically. We know what makes a plumber's phone ring versus what just looks nice. Plus we list you on our directory and optimise for AI search, which is pretty specialist stuff. But look, just have a look at what I've built — if your nephew can do better, no hard feelings."

### "I can't afford it right now"

> "Totally understand. Look — what does an average job earn you? [£200-500+]. This website pays for itself with one extra job. And it works 24/7 — while you're on a job, while you're asleep, it's out there getting you found. I can do £200 upfront and £200 next month if that helps?"

### "I'll think about it"

> "Of course, no pressure at all. I'll send you the link so you can show the missus / have a proper look tonight. Can I check back with you Monday? The site's built anyway, so whenever you're ready it takes me 24 hours to get it live."

### "I already have a website"

> "Nice — I had a look actually. Can I be honest? [Be specific about what's wrong: slow, not mobile-friendly, no reviews showing, no schema markup]. Your reviews are excellent but your website doesn't show that off. I can either build you a new one, or if you just want to be listed on our directory for extra visibility, that's free."

### "What's TradeHub?"

> "We're a local trades directory — think like a modern Checkatrade but free for our listed tradespeople. We list top-rated trades across [AREA] and help them get found online, especially through AI search which is where everything's heading. We also build websites specifically designed to make tradespeople's phones ring."

### "Is this a scam / too good to be true?"

> "Ha, I get it — you probably get 10 calls a day from people selling SEO nonsense. This is different — I've literally already built your website. Have a look at the link, that's real work I've done for your business. I'm Austin Mander, I run a software company called GenFlow Systems. You can Google me. I'm local, I'm building this directory because I saw a gap — top-rated tradespeople like you invisible online while cowboys with websites are getting the calls."

### If NO:
1. Be gracious: "No worries at all, was nice chatting"
2. Still offer the free directory listing: "Happy to list you on our directory anyway — free, no catch. More visibility for you."
3. Still plant the referral seed
4. Move on. Next call.

## Saturday Calling Tips

- **Best time to call tradesmen on Saturday:** 7:30-9:00am (before they start jobs) or 12:00-1:30pm (lunch break)
- **They might be on a job** — keep it brief, offer to call back: "Sounds like you're busy — when's a good time for 5 minutes?"
- **Be human** — these are regular blokes, not corporate buyers. Chat like a person.
- **Energy matters** — if you sound excited about what you've built, they'll feel it
- **Track everything** — note down name, outcome, objection, follow-up date in a spreadsheet
- **Numbers game** — expect 10-20% close rate on cold calls. 30 calls = 3-6 clients = £1,200-2,400. Not bad for a Saturday.

## The Key Insight

You're not selling websites. You're saying:

"I found you, I was impressed by your reviews, I built you something, and I want to list you on our directory. Have a look."

That's not a sales call. That's a compliment with a gift attached. Most people will at least look.
