# TradeHub — Sales Pitch & Scripts

## Cold Call Script

> **Ring ring...**
>
> "Hi, is that [Name]? My name's Austin — I run a local trades directory called TradeHub. I'm reaching out to [trade type] businesses in [area] because I'm building a network of trusted tradespeople and I think you'd be a great fit.
>
> Basically, I build professional websites for tradespeople and list you on our local directory — it helps you show up when people Google things like '[trade] in [area]'. Most of my clients are getting new enquiries within the first month.
>
> I'm not trying to sell you anything today — I just wanted to see if you'd be open to a quick chat about what I can do for you? It's nothing like Checkatrade — no monthly lead fees, you own everything I build, and it starts from just a couple of hundred quid.
>
> Would that be worth a 5-minute conversation?"

### If they say yes:
> "Great — what's the best way to show you? I can send you a link to what I've built for other tradespeople in the area, and we can have a quick call later this week if you like what you see."

### If they say they're busy:
> "No worries at all — I know you're on the tools. Can I send you a quick text with my details and a link? You can have a look when you get a minute and let me know."

### If they say not interested:
> "Fair enough, I appreciate your time. Just so you know, I'm listing local tradespeople on our directory for free at the moment — no strings attached. Can I add you so people in [area] can find you? It's just your name, trade, and phone number on a Google-friendly page."

## Objection Handling

### "It's too expensive"
> "I totally get that. Just to put it in perspective — one job from Google covers the entire cost. My starter package is £100–200 for a professional site that's yours to keep. Most agencies charge £2,000+ for the same thing. And the hosting is £30 a month — less than a tank of diesel. If you get even one extra job a month from it, you're well in profit."

### "I already have Facebook"
> "Facebook's great for word of mouth, and you should definitely keep using it. But here's the thing — when someone Googles 'plumber in Solihull', Facebook doesn't show up. A proper website does. Think of it this way: Facebook is where people who already know you find you. A website is where new customers who don't know you yet find you. You want both."

### "I don't need a website"
> "I hear that a lot, and honestly? Your best customers are the ones actively searching for a [trade] right now on Google. If you're not there, they're going to your competitor who is. Even a simple one-page site with your services, area, and phone number can bring in 5–10 new enquiries a month. And once it's built, it works for you 24/7 — even when you're on a job."

### "My nephew/mate does IT"
> "That's fair — but is it actually done? I speak to a lot of tradespeople who've been waiting 6 months for their nephew to finish the site. What I do is specifically for tradespeople — I know what converts, I know the SEO, and I include a listing on our local directory which gives you a backlink and extra visibility. I can have it live in a couple of days, not a couple of months."

### "I tried a website before and it didn't work"
> "I'm sorry to hear that. Nine times out of ten, when a website 'doesn't work', it's because it wasn't set up for SEO. It looked nice but Google couldn't find it. What I do is different — every site I build has proper schema markup, is submitted to Google, and gets a backlink from our trades directory. It's built to rank, not just look pretty."

### "How do I know it'll bring me work?"
> "I can't guarantee a specific number of jobs — anyone who does is lying. But what I can guarantee is that your site will be properly optimised for Google, listed on our directory, and set up so that when people search for a [trade] in [area], you have a real chance of showing up. Right now, you have zero chance because you're not there."
