## For Directory Use
All prospects are strong candidates for TradeHub listings:
- Mix of with/without websites — all lack AI optimisation
- Emergency trades = high-intent search niche
- Our directory with llms.txt would actually rank better for AI queries
- Cross-linking benefits them (backlink from TradeHub) and us (authority from listing quality trades)
